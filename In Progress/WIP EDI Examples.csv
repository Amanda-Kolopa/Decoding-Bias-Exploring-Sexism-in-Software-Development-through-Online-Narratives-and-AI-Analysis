About year 10 I started to realize that while I'd been absolutely fine until I entered leadership / seniority roles, trying to lead a man or team of men was hell. Absolute hell. I tried company after company where I was hired in to lead a small team and the entire ( always all male ) team would actively conspire from minute one to not just undermine me but make my life a living hell. A united front of active sabotage. I am not alone. Every research into lady-leavers from tech shows the exact same thing. Once we should be leading, we try... then flee tech in droves.

I have and have had  for a decade now an array of small, ultra-niche software products that I make and sell online. The first couple I attached my actual name too. I'd endlessly get harassing email from men trying to ""help"" that were just berating tirades saying I seem like a ditz, floozy, incompetent moron and that I should let them help. They attached their names, titles and companies to these emails! They actually thought they were helping. Now I use a made-up male name and I literally get emails saying I'm awesome ( which I never got for female-faced products ).

Anyway, that's where I went. I hide. Behind a man's name. I do freelancing under my own name occasionally but even then I have a made up ""boss"" that is a dude. Whenever a client refuses to trust my expertise, I say I'll check with my boss then send an email saying exactly what I said but from my ""boss."" Usually they then email back thanking him and talking shit about me. It sucks. It sucks so hard. but my bills are paid, I get to do the work I enjoy ( the actual work I love ) and facing the endless barrage of misogyny wasn't fucking helping anyone. It just made my life hell.

**Where did you go?**

In case you, somehow, don't know the pipeline problem is a myth. The gender gap in tech roles is because we leave. The pay gap is not on us. Its on the people who decide what to (under-)pay us. Even Google was investigated and found liable by the DOJ for systemically underpaying women.

This bias of 'if a woman has gotten this far is CS she must be pretty special/amazing' is held by both male and female supervisors. Which is a shame! As it means mediocre men get a free pass when it comes to most work whereas we're expected to live up to impossible standards placed on us by being a minority that has gotten far. 

However, as with your situation, I think female supervisors might be more guilty than male when it comes to holding these expectations.

Based on my own experience and the experience of most women in tech that I've met and read the stories of, bias and career related stress because of it happens to *most* of us. Women being told they are ""too confident"" or ""overly aggressive"" or ""not assertive enough"" is far more common than in men. Sexual harassment and discrimination happen in every industry, but it is definitely prominent in tech. More women leave tech at a faster pace than a lot of other industries. Ignoring this is one strategy (it doesn't remove the fact that bias exists). I did that at the beginning of my career, but it didn't help my mental health pretending that *I* must have somehow done something wrong when many of the people around me were often gaslighting, dismissive, or straight up sexist due to my gender.

I'd argue that recognizing this stuff does exist and being a part of the community for support is a lot healthier for our wellbeing than just pretending there isn't a problem or blaming someone's mindset based on their real experience.

Knowing that I'm not the crazy one and that this stuff exists is how I've been able to navigate a career where there are plenty of toxic environments.

In that time, I have been promoted twice, and I've grown to love my work more and more. I am an integral part of our most important projects in a wide space. I love the impact I have on a day to day basis. 

The problem is the crushing sexism. I am somehow the most senior female in our entire reporting line in engineering at the company. Two women just quit due to sexist/unfair treatment. I felt close with both of them. I used to work in a different industry that was female dominated before I changed careers and got this job. Culture shock - to say the least. 

My bosses - up to the VP - can admit that I am an integral part of our division's success & that our chances of pulling off ambitious goals require me in seat working at full force. 

So why""¦.why does it feel like they're always working against me? Why do I get constantly undercut? Why do they not listen & take action when I risk saying something about how demoralizing and sapping the sexism is?

Types of sexism:
- sexual harassment from a boss, who was demoted, but his actions are very much indicative of the lack of respect that pervades the company culture
- constant micro aggressions
- even when I am the lead engineer on a project and the only expert in the room, I am cut out of meetings, denied important information, talked down to, interrupted when presenting important counter points just to have the basics explained to me
- verbal harassment (I.e. being publicly humiliated in meetings for""¦.utterly unclear reasons. There are 2 men who I can clearly identify as threatened by me. They are nasty about it)
- when I try to work with my boss on these issues he occasionally feigns empathy, more often rushes out of the conversation, never does anything
- when I try to work with my skip-level (who was my boss for 1.5 yrs, and once called me the best entry level software engineer he'd ever encountered in his 20+ year career) he gets passive aggressive for a few weeks at a time &""¦.idk the conflict just makes me feel miserable. I can tell that my advocacy for myself and others on the team has made him lose considerable respect for me & has no productive outcome. 

Things that keep me going (for guilt or good reason):
- that second promotion""¦I negotiated hard. I get a giant lump sum in October for bonus and back pay. I'll feel terrible if I leave right after that. 
- there are three young female devs that were just hired. They are all so sharp in different ways. They're not all on my direct team, but I keep one on ones with them to make sure they're ok. I'm scared of what could happen to them if I wasn't around to help them deal with""¦.the wheel of misery that this company keeps serving. 
- we just started my dream project. No one else on the team has the skill set to pull it off. I'm excited to be leading ""” even if the people in charge struggle to acknowledge that that's what's happening. I have been looking forward to this for months. I don't want to quit without implementing this
- I have a crushing fear that, coming from a female dominated industry, my standards will be too high, and I'll never find a company where I feel comfortable. I'm terrified that this is the best & I'll never find better

Wise women: how have you made alliances with bosses who don't get it? How much is too much? How do you cope and convince yourself not to care?

In all the places I've worked, I've witnessed people volunteering massive amounts of overtime to get projects done and in turn they get the better assignments, but that also then leads them to being able to promote more toxic behaviors.

I got lucky enough to work for a company where the males respected me as much as they respected anyone else, and there were always a couple females on the team. My manager was a total bro in other ways, but believed that family came first, so getting time off when I needed it wasn't a problem. 

I took a lucrative contract managing a team at a customer site (I work for a staffing company, did their internal IT, was looking for a change and took this customer facing role) and man, is the culture here at the client company different.

I'm getting out of here as soon as my replacement is hired. If I had started my career at a company like this, I wouldn't have wanted to stay in tech and I would not encourage my daughters to go into a tech field.

I guess the way for a company to address this would be to support the women who work for them and encourage them to be role models for the next generation, and make sure those women feel good about being role models by helping men identify and reduce their unconscious biases so the workplace is welcoming to women. They should also support flexible hours and generous time off policies for ALL workers, without stigma - while women may be the default to take time off for family members, giving men the opportunity to do the same will enable them to split caregiving responsibilities more evenly.

And parents, for the love of God, make sure your sons are exposed to competent women growing up, and your responsibilities at home are relatively balanced.

* Make it more painful to avoid completing the project/request than completing it, but you have to avoid taking on the burden of tracking while doing this. In our culture, men typically expect women to take all responsibility for anything we assign out or delegate, requiring us to follow up (thus assigning us the role of a ""nag."") So the only way I have accomplished this is by taking notes (assigned on date, promised by date.) Then, lightly shame him in a group chat or meeting, using facts of date, promise, and the natural consequences to the project of him not doing as promised.

* Probably needless to say, but be more competent and knowledgeable than others on the team to gain respect. 

* Consider recruiting more women into your team. I personally decided to start my own business and create very specific structures to avoid this problem. I mostly employ women but also maintain a flat hierarchy with teamwork a main focus.

Their entire attention span goes to how women look and make them feel. - OP described the woman's look and profile in great detail but failed to ask her name, title and what she was even doing there. OP didn't even stop to question if he was in wrong room since obviously she was meeting someone in that room. 

Women in tech get this treatment every single day. A short while ago I was introducing myself to a male colleague who I've only ever talked on the phone and on email before, so face to face for the first time ever, and he had the audacity to say ""oh hi, don't really recognize any women with their clothes on so pardon my mistake for not knowing who you were instantly."" Just casually like he actually thought that was an appropriate thing to say.

I've had to deal with a LOT of sexism. 

The truth is that some men will just NOT see women as equals or fully capable peers. When **you** aren't fully a person in someone else's eyes, it's nearly impossible for **you** to get through to them. What I would recommend is finding someone who men do respect (which means another *man*) to call the men out on their sexism. Someone who is an ally to you and doesn't have the same baseline bias against women. 

It sounds like you already have a guy like that, your friend who reviewed your code and then got credit for it. I'd recommend telling that guy what these other guys have been doing and saying toward you, and ask if he could please call them out on their bullshit when someone says something. 

The guys bullying you - and they ARE bullying you - are cowards as all bullies are. Being confronted by a male peer who they respect will embarrass them and hopefully open their eyes to their prejudicial behavior.

Other things that you could do could be to not entertain their bad faith arguments. If they say ""this is unintelligible"" ask them what THEY do not understand. Make it about THEIR failings, rather than internalizing that it's something that YOU did wrong...but honestly, I'm trying to take my own advice here and it is HARD. I'm a logical person, and it's hard for me to recognize someone giving an emotional, illogical bad faith argument. 

They'll accuse us of being illogical, emotional women, but it's projection - they are banding together against ""the other"" (the person who is least like ""them"") due to their personal massive insecurity about their own competence. Instead of reflecting on why they feel insecure, they take it out on the ""girl"" encroaching ""on THEIR turf."" It's so stupid. But that's why someone who IS ""like them"" is going to get through to them when you can't.

I wish I could headbutt these guys straight into the sun for you. Don't worry about being a bitch, because really, their behavior is stereotypical mean girl behavior. For me, my self-respect is really important. I *never* want to feel like a doormat that people walk all over without any caution. If standing up for myself makes me a bitch, I can respect myself if I'm a bitch - bitches have teeth they can and will use, after all.

1. The majority of the time you will be one of few women. You will just have to accept it and adjust.

2. If you are new to the field, learn as much as you can. Don't be afraid to ask questions. I think women get intimidated too quickly. But if you are new it's normal and expected. If you think it's a dumb question ask any way, you will look worse the longer you take to understand something.

3. If you think you know what you are doing, make sure people know it's you that did 100 percent of the work and you didn't ask any one for help. Unfortunately theres a lot of bias.

4. Don't complain to the company and don't ask for raises. They will see you as a problem.

5. If you truly unhappy, just look for another job while doing your job. Companies will make your life harder if they know you are looking to leave

I came from a very rigorous university and worked my ass off to get to a more senior role and earn the respect of my male peers.

My tech lead, Rob, is one of the smartest and looked up to senior engineers in the org. Right now just the two of us were assigned to a project. I've been extremely lucky to have him as my lead and learn from him. 

Yesterday the other woman, about my age, came to me for help in an area directly related to my and Rob's project. Keep in mind, everyone always goes to Rob for help for this, but because of the current health craze, he's not readily available, so I am here to cover for him.

Anyway, I happily spend several hours helping her and not only showing her, but also teaching her what needs to be done. Then towards the end she asks me ""what should I do now?"" I say ""based on all we tried so far, best thing to do is X"", and I suddenly don't hear back from her. 

During our org sync up today, her manager asked her for an update, and she says in front of everyone ""I ran into some issues earlier, but thanks to Rob""˜s suggestion to do X, I made progress and here are the results""

I felt pretty betrayed. She asked Rob for the same help, realized he was offline, so she came to me, which is fine. Then when he came back online several hours later, he was able to respond to her missed question with the same suggestion. She just ended up using his name to put more weight to her results.

So I may be the only visbible F software engineer in our team. 

I've gotten it all in my career- mentored my peers who then thought I owed them ""favours"", being told software engineering isn't for me. 

- Know your craft, and your worth, so know your stack and be confident that you know it. Peers and colleagues will magnify your mistake and ask if you think engineering is really for you. 

- Which brings me to my next point, always play on your top skills- even if they are soft skills. I love talking to people and getting us together which overlap with scrum skills whilst my team just want to code all the time. If you have soft skills and are a people person- play to them! It'll become your USP as long as you are also a good engineer. Don't let anyone tell you managerial positions would suit you better. A lot of big tech want people who are good engineers and have people skills too. 

- Don't feel like you need to become the poster girl for diversity or ""woke culture"", encourage your team to educate themselves. Question lack of diversity (whether this is racial/gender diversity) but make sure your team mates educate themselves rather than it just being on you. 

 - Make allies with other women. I have had experiences of bitchy women who will push you over and really amazing women. Try to make allies with women in positions of power (who are nice), generally they will look out for you if you ever have any issues. I was harassed once in a previous job and knew the Head of HR for my unit who helped me immensely, especially when it came to leaving that job.

I've had my fair share of 'small' but very annoying sexism at my job(s). Nothing horrible but it does add up.

The director of IT at my old place of employment insisted I'd be good at cleaning and organizing our lab because I have 'natural talent' for it. I asked why he would think that (did he notice my extremely organized and immaculate office? Cause... he needs to improve his observation skills if he thought that), and he responded about how his wife was super good at it and all the women he knows are. I think he was just oblivious as heck. 

Vendors always ask if there's someone in IT they can speak with, or if they can talk to the network administrator. It's me. They typically sound a little embarrassed when they realize that. 

Men and women at my current job just cannot handle the fact that I was getting up on a ladder to install some access points. Like, should you be doing that?! Why did the boys make you do this kind of thing? Be careful! Omg can I help in any way? 

Wish people would just let me do my job. 

Edit: I was given advice by a female dev at my old job when I left. She said that we (as women) constantly have to prove we know what we're doing, despite education level and experience. But we get really good at it over time. It wears you down I suppose, but it helps with some of the type of work in IT for sure. I am super confident in my abilities because I've had to back them up so often.

There were scores of comments regarding male peers who did stupid things - and one comment about a female engineer who did something stupid. The comment about the female engineer received a reply citing a study about how women, due to their gender, struggle more with programming due to inherent qualities of their gender (I'm paraphrasing, bottom line is he cited a study and used it to say the coworker did something stupid because she was a woman).

I responded ""if someone cited a study every time a man did something stupid, we'd have studies on every other comment here."" (For example (
[just hypothetical] men are on average more impulsive, maybe that makes them worse programmers?)

I got angry replies for this. Apparently, because I pointed out that coincidentally a gender-based study was only cited for the woman who did something stupid, I was anti-science and anti-fact, I wanted to suppress this man's right to speak, I believed that men and women were exactly the same. Etc etc. I tried explaining further that this implies stupid men are stupid because of who they are as individuals, but a stupid woman represents her entire gender. Ie men are allowed to be judged on their own merits as human beings, a woman's actions must represent her gender. They didn't want to hear any of it.

It was hilariously tragic. Just pointing out their possible bias (really? Citing gender as a reason for a stupid action on the one woman-centered incident in a sea of other stupid actions?) instantly made them defensive and fearful.

By 'something interesting', I mean something I really, really dislike. It seems to me like men are freely allowed in spaces that were created with female / nb devs in mind. In some cases, I feel that the event / group organizers are too permissive of who they let join in order to not seem mean or gatekeeper-y. This is a problem, because I believe that we need spaces independent of men, since we're such a minority in the industry, and as such have our own specific issues.


In my own city, there's an in-person meetup and they're just too lenient about who can be in the group. They say that all genders are allowed to join the group, and so what's happened is quite a few weird dudes have joined. It feels like the type of men who show up to these groups -- which in name are clearly not for them -- are the type to be boundary-crossers. For example, one dude at the meetup asked if he could critique my C# code. I said no. And then he did it anyway!


The presence of men in these spaces is just so uncomfortable to me. I don't feel like I can speak freely whenever they're there.

I guess you could make the argument that they're trying to be allies. Which, fine if they want to do that. But showing up to and participating in a space that was not meant for you is certainly not the way to do it...

It is so deeply unfair to women in tech that we have to constantly be protecting ourselves from behavior like this, which distracts us from the work we love and the career progression we want. 

As others have said, you should tell him clearly ""I'd like some space and think we should keep things strictly work-related between us."" Honestly, just get the words out. You don't have to be assertive or even look him in the eyes as you say it if you don't feel like it. If you do it verbally, write down exactly what time/situation you said it in and if it's over text, keep screenshots. You just need to establish the fact that you asked him to leave you alone. 

At that point, ball is in his and your company's court. Do you generally trust management and HR at your company? It seems like overall you have a positive impression of the place. If he continues engaging you on anything not work-related after you do the above, bring it to them immediately. The more dates/times and details you can provide them the better.

Do you think any of your friends or some kind of mentor figure at the company would be able to help out by shielding you from this guy? I really don't like the idea of you being left out of activities if the guy starts making it uncomfortable for you to be in the room playing ping pong etc after you confront him. If other people who you trust know the situation, this is less likely to happen.

Personally as a female senior SWE who has become a fairly valuable eng over the course of my \~5 year career so far, I am absolutely hell bent on making sure this shit doesn't happen around me - I will and have raised hell to management over this shit, and I'm sure there are people at your company who feel the same. If management is halfway decent they don't really want to upset their unicorn ""experienced female SWE's"" to protect some clueless dipshit who *almost certainly* causes other problems if he's doing this to you.  A lot of women (and men!) are starting to get really sick of this nonsense.

Maybe that's another way you can frame this in your mind to make it more palatable to deal with it. The fact that you care about other people and want to make them feel comfortable and safe isn't a pathology; it's a fantastic trait that will serve you well in your career. But try to see the forest through the trees - you stand to make a lot more, more worthy people feel happier and safer over the longer term if you say *fuck it* and and stand up yourself.

Wanted to see how common this was in your workplace or in the world of software development in general. How frequently do you feel that the amount of effort you put into programming  something doesn't get appreciated enough?

I work for a multidisciplinary team of various engineers, software developers, mathematicians etc. I've had to singlehandedly put together an end-to-end program that honestly has been such great progress for our project. Without all of the development I've done we wouldn't be able to test anything concrete, or have anything physical to show for. 

And yet, it feels as though my work is insignificant. Only a few people have truly acknowledged what I've put together. I've noticed most of the props go to the Mech Engrs, and though yes credit should be given to them, what they created would do nothing if it weren't for my code. I was even told by one of the project leads that ""sorry software folks. You are doing great work but code stuff is just boring to present about.""

This lack of acknowledgment usually results to project leads establishing unknowingly overwhelming programming goals. They don't realize it's overwhelming because they have no appreciation for the work that goes into making the code do what it can do now. I've had to sit with a group of mech engrs the other day (and other software devs, unfortunately), coming up with big picture ideas for the next test they want to do, not once asking for my two cents, if what they wanted was possible programming-wise in within two months time (luckily it is). Just crazy. 

I don't really need recognition for the work that I do. I was just caught off guard about how easily programming efforts are forgotten and was wondering how common this is? I've only worked 3 yrs in the industry so still discovering new things.

On top of the imposter syndrome from being a woman in a male dominated field, I feel like an imposter among other women in the field because of my lack of technical education, and lack of proficiency in math/science, for that matter. I see all these posts made by women/non cis-white males here who are struggling to get a job in the tech field who are probably way more qualified than me. I know that isn't a fair judgment to make on myself, but the guilt I'm feeling is real.

In my first 1.5 years on the job, I was very driven because I was trying to prove to myself and everyone else that I was competent enough to be there. Lately, I've been pretty unmotivated and uninspired, so now I feel guilty about that too.

It's so difficult to stop feeling like this when I'm the only woman on my team. I get along with my now teammates pretty well, but I struggle to feel like I can really be myself around them, and get the help I need from any of my superiors. Especially because I can offer a looooong list of the number of times I have been talked over in meetings, my efforts and achievements have gone unacknowledged (someone literally used my solution for an internal competition and won money for it), coworkers watching YouTube videos while I'm trying to talk to them, etc. It's not always so bad, but even my male coworkers who I started to trust have disappointed me in one way or another. 

So I've tried to turn to groups for women to connect but I feel like such an outsider that I stop myself from doing that either (except this time!). I like coding and I like doing dev work. But I still feel like I barely know anything about the industry (what are all of these terms/acronyms and where tf do you learn them???), and I don't have any drive outside of my working hours anymore, and so somehow I guess I feel like I don't deserve the connection with other people in my position.

As someone who has done a lot of hiring, and run larger teams, don't even worry about this. Male tech managers get a lot of flack from HR if they don't have a good gender balance on their teams (teams of 10 men with zero women -- it happens a lot) and the pressure to interview (and hire) women applicants gets pretty intense. It often ends up on their KPIs (i.e. ""you will not get a bonus at the end of the year unless you have hired at least three more female software developers."")

The sexism that you will experience won't be around getting interviews or being hired. It will be around:

* Not getting paid an equivalent salary to your male colleagues of equal experience. (Make sure you know what they are getting.)
* Not having your contributions valued.
* Getting stuck with ""glue"" work, such as project management or custom liaison work that doesn't increase your tech skills.
* Not getting promoted even when you have demonstrated capability.
* Being assumed not to be technical when you are in meetings with people that don't know you.

I am female.  I remember being swamped by terms that I didn't understand other then being a general concept.  One of those ideas was called 'computer programing'.  That phrase alone made me think it was a great mystery and would be very hard to do.  But, I also wasn't aware exactly what they did.

Until I read an article that explained it to me in terms I understood as a regular citizen in society.  The article explained that computer programing was like explaining to someone who never used a phone how to use it.  The object was to explain it every step of the way.  Once all the steps were done and all should work, the article then asked, ""what happens should I get a busy signal?""  Then certain steps are repeated or one stops trying.

This articale not only taught me what programming was doing when it's written, it also explained the process of using the computer itself as I also understood what steps the computer was using to 'get from here to there'. Further study brought up the experience I needed to trouble shoot computer problems and how to repair them.

Should someone think about all the steps it takes to make a phone call (even to the point of saying pick up the phone) one would begin to see a long process of logical steps we use to do something as mundane as using the phone.  Programming uses all these steps to tell the computer how to respond to the goals of a program.  Those steps are extremely detailed and become very repetitive. Women work well in those positions as women are prone to thinking out all details and progressing towards a goal until a finished project appears.

I would add that, as a woman, speaking up and wanting credit can turn some people against you.

It is so common for women to be labeled difficult or not team players when they ask for credit. 

If you're not worried about that, do make sure there is a written record but remember that start-ups don't have as many HR policies in place that protect women. Calendar invites, emails, and slack messages can be deleted. Or conversations can happen behind your back to change the narrative. Maintain any written records you want for yourself - save emails as pdfs, save chat text, take notes after meetings.

Sorry.

>Basically I am refusing any 'soft' work unless someone can explain howit is part of my job and I see that my peer tech leads are doing thesame work.

Yes, that is your best option on that situation. For women, we are constantly pushed away from technical roles and rolling back that is very very hard if not directly impossible.

For my last job jump I simply removed from my cv every trace of me being a PM or sales person. That never happened. Repeat with me: I am not a good manager, don't hire me as a manager. If you are not looking for a strictly technical person, I am not interested in your job offer.

I used only my technical skills and my technical experience. And it worked. I'm back at being a Senior Software Engineer on my path to Principal. No more soft skills management roles for me. Not anymore.

Also. moving to a company with active and realistic diversity and inclusive strategies worked better for me.

>I know the 'soft' side of things is important to keep advancing in my career but I can't help feeling like I'm already being typecast again in this new role.

The more I advance on my career the less I believe this is true **for women**. If we are perceived as ""soft skilled"" we are just pushed outside our technical roles. But, you know, what I want to do is being technical. So showing good soft skills don't work for my career.

So I am no longer a soft skilled employee. I am a team player, a nice person, an easy to work with peer, a well organized developer,... but a mess if you try to make me do management tasks. I am now a hard metal rock star punk ninja whatever developer and you better deal with that.

They instituted math puzzle tests for hiring purposes that gave men who had taken math classes an advantage, and personality tests that purported to find the ideal â€œprogramming type.â€

My personal experience: I love being a programmer. I can't imagine doing much else. When I first heard the stat that around half of women leave tech around 35, I was devastated, and kind of in denial. That'd never be me. I thought.

However, I've had some messed up experiences since, and... I get it. My expertise has been ignored again and again, even when I'm clearly the most expert person in the room, and if I dare say something about it, even kindly, I'm labeled ""abrasive"". You run into these people you can't win with. Because the problem isn't how you behave, it's what you look like to them and what they assume about you, and if you challenge their worldview, it just makes them hate you more.

The worst part is that people know they can't look outright sexist, but it doesn't change their underlying beliefs about you. So if you're dealing with a smart asshole, it only ever shows itself in ways they can plausibly deny. I've started to feel crazy and wonder if it was just me. I'm only confident it's not because of keeping logs and frequently checking in with other people to make sure I wasn't messing up.

I've experienced many of the ""isms"" in this industry (sexism, racism, agism both older to younger at work and younger to older during interviews). I've noticed recently that younger female friends and family members have asked me repeatedly if they should persue a career in CS and my response has changed from an emphatic yes to a strong no based on my experiences. I love programming and system design work but the personalities you deal with on a daily basis take up more of your emotional time than the former.

There are so many things wrong with this industry it's actually insane how they haven't been addressed.

-	The insane leetcode interview process that IMO discriminates against older developers with children
-	A lot of programs to get ""girls"" and ""young women"" into coding but none or very few to support you while you're actually in industry 
-	[Documented pay discrimination from so called progressive companies ](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/22/google-gender-pay-discrimination-lawsuit)
-	Discrimination in this industry based on race isn't blatant but rather death by a thousand papercuts. My experience with sexism has been similar 
-	Gatekeeping at every level including by experienced female managers and engineers who feel there's only room at the top for them as women 
-	male engineers constantly doubting your competence and challenging your work disproportionately in comparison to male engineers 
-	I personally have not experienced this but a friend did and I've heard many in industry experience performance improvement plans coming back from maternity leave which is so fucked up

girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:03,2023-09-28 23:34,syrenashen,Post,Ode to my women mentors and women managers,16v0vi3,"I'm a woman who's been in this industry for 10 years, 15 years including internships. I never coded before college, but due to a large amount of encouragement from both women and men around me, I got a degree in CS against my parents' wishes and my own expectations of myself.

I've been talking to many women in this industry and reading about their experiences here which made me realize how lucky and unique my experiences were (although I don't think it's just luck\*), so I wanted to virtually thank the many women mentors in my life that have helped get me where I am today.

I was lucky to have gone to a school that didn't have a 50/50 ratio in CS but it wasn't far off either. It's an engineering school that consciously tries to maintain a balanced ratio. My CS class was around 60/40 which was really fucking great, so I never had the experience of being the only woman in the class. I didn't know how to code AT ALL, and tbh it was a huge struggle but no one said ""girls shouldn't be here"" or anything to me just because there were so many amazing female role models, professors, TAs, and grad students around.

My first serious internship was an internship at Google. I applied super late because I didn't believe I'd get accepted (I applied in May which, if you have normal summer internship experience, that's very late for an internship that starts in June). There weren't many projects left but someone at Google saw my resume and picked me up and asked for a super late internship slot for me, got it approved, and that was when I got my dream of interning at Google. I learned how to program there. I had never done production-level coding on a team before; most of my schoolwork was solo coding or theory-based so I had not worked with more than 1 person on a codebase. So that internship really taught me a lot.

My mentor was also great; I was out sick for a few weeks during the 12 week internship, and she got an approval to extend the internship a few weeks so I could submit my project and get a return offer. I didn't end up going back to Google, but she taught me a lot. At the time, I felt guilty & thought ""Gee why is this woman spending all of her time teaching me, a clueless noob, the complete basics of coding including how to use the command line? And debugging things for me when things go wrong? This can't be fun or benefitial to her."" I felt like I brought no value as an intern, but she told me that bringing value as an intern is considered going above and beyond.

After that I worked at a company that had almost no women. It was super toxic and people were constantly threatening & harassing each other. I got reported to HR a few times for stupid things like my short skirt bothered people. I left after 6 months.

Then after that I got a job where I had a series of managers. My first manager, a man, was nice to my face but shit talked about me behind my back. People were coming up to me telling me that my manager was disappointed in my progress, thought I was a mistake hire, etc, and I didn't understand why or how to improve because he never said ANY criticism to my face. He always said ""good job"" and didn't bother to give me any direction on what to work on. I cried a bunch after receiving that 2nd-hand feedback, until suddenly my manager quits and I got a new manager, a woman.

Some male co-workers told me my new manager sucked, and I cried again and contemplated switching teams. But she was really nice and supportive. She told me that she would help me get promoted, something my previous manager never ever mentioned. I felt like she cared about me as a person and my growth as an engineer. She maintained a team that was around 50% women. I have a few close friends from that team still. I ended up transferring teams anyway, though I left on a high note, and she gave me glowing reviews to my new team.

My next manager was also a woman, and we were in a satellite office. The team was >50% women. We even had cancel the ""Women in Tech"" ERG chapter in that satellite office because it was too many women. She said it felt like it would be more exclusionary than inclusionary due to the office being >50% women. I didn't get along with her too well due to differences in opinion, but she still treated me fairly. Again, I really appreciated being in such a balanced gender team. I did end up getting laid off during a companywide layoff during COVID, and she cried when I was laid off and was super supportive. She also quit afterwards in protest.

After that, I joined a new company and a team that was again 50% or even >50% women at times, under a woman manager. She was amazing. She was both my manager and my mentor. First of all, she hired me at a higher level than I was expecting. I literally thought there was no way I'd be hired in at that level. So much so that I only found out I was hired at that level *after I joined*. (It was an L for negotiation though.) After that, she got me by far the highest impact projects on the team and promoted me again in 1 year. I never thought I'd be in this position and gained so much confidence from the experience because my previous career trajectory was not going anywhere near that fast. I realized just how important your manager's support is.

Finally, now I started a startup with another woman, a three-time successful founder, and we just got funded by a top VC. I'm super excited and find her super inspirational. In fact, every day I feel lucky that she picked me of all people to work with. She has lots of different strengths that are complimentary to mine, and I learn a lot from just observing her interact with the product & the people around us every day. I feel super lucky.

Anyway, all this to say: TL;DR: Female mentors and managers have been the reason I'm where I am today. Balanced gender ratio teams are fucking awesome. Keep fighting for this world because as someone who has worked with a few male managers and heavily male-dominated teams, it makes a HUGE difference. I've had a few male mentors as well, but this is an ode to my most wonderful, superhuman, generous, kind, inspirational, selfless, extremely competent woman mentors ðŸ™âœ¨

\*I don't think it's just luck but also selection bias. I think women managers are more likely to hire women, and also women like me are more likely to join teams with more women. I've had offers where I'd be the only woman and that always gave me the ick.

I can answer this one! I had two close female friends in my college CS program. I ended up working for a large government research lab. Another ended up in a large company. The third has worked in various startups and consulting firms. 

First off, grain of salt: I am one of those ""don't really dress up and speak very bluntly"" sorts, so I'm not certain how well my experiences will translate to yours. 

I've had a very easy time of it as a woman. All of my management is female. All of my team mates are male but I've not experienced any negative behavior from any of them; I feel respected and equal, and I've never felt pressured to behave inappropriately. I'd say the biggest gap between me and them is that most of them have kids, and I don't. 

A lot of the women at my workplace do dress up and present themselves in a more feminine manner, but at meetings (women's group and LGBT group) folks mostly talk about how level and welcoming my workplace is.

I've encountered one coworker who did treat me condescendingly, but I'm not certain how much of it was my gender and how much of it was other factors: he's older, but was being forced into working in my software, where my skills are much stronger. 

My friend in large industry also reported at one point that she hadn't seen any kind of discrimination, though we haven't stayed in touch very well. 

My friend who went into startups has had to deal with a few bumps along the way. There's been very little that was overt, but she frequently would have ""soft"" work (communication, documentation, meetings, etc) handed to her ""because you're better at those things."" She pushed back and eventually that work was more fairly distributed, but it was definitely a rough spot and it's something that has cropped up for her at multiple small companies. She's working for herself now and hasn't really encountered anything negative from clients that I'm aware of.

As someone who shifted from psychology to computer science: it's a very different environment and that has a lot to do with feeling like an outsider in my experience. For me, it was partially being ""the girl"" in the CS program (there were only 5 or 6 of us in a large program) but it was also feeling like an outsider until I found my feet socially. It was  impossible for me to tell which was which until I figured out the different social norms and settled in. Especially at college (and especially from certain groups) I have encountered some different treatment (sometimes positive, sometimes negative), but it has usually worn off quickly as people interacted with me, and it was never overt.

(Video games are another story entirely; even after I found my feet in online games, there was and is a ton of overt discrimination, and I've never managed to get over that ""something to prove"" feeling there. So I have definitely experienced what you're talking about.)

Also: don't underestimate or undervalue your experiences in humanities or ""softer"" sciences. My psychology background still comes into play even decades later. Find ways to make that previous experience work for you and you'll never regret it.",3289,feminine-coded goods and services,bad misogyny discrimination professional tech sphere really awesome inclusive workplace exist unicorn answer one two close female friend college cs program end work large government research lab another end large company third work various startup consult firm first grain salt one really dress speak bluntly sort certain well experience translate easy time woman management female team mate male experienced negative behavior feel respect equal never felt pressured behave inappropriately say big gap kid lot woman workplace dress present feminine manner meeting woman group lgbt group folk mostly talk level welcoming workplace encounter one coworker treat condescendingly certain much gender much factor older force work software skill much strong friend large industry also report one point see kind discrimination though stayed touch well friend go startup deal bump along way little overt frequently would soft work communication documentation meeting etc hand good thing push back eventually work fairly distribute definitely rough spot something crop multiple small company work really encounter anything negative client aware someone shift psychology computer science different environment lot feel like outsider experience partially girl c program 5 6 us large program also feel like outsider find foot socially impossible tell figure different social norm settle especially college especially certain group encounter different treatment sometimes positive sometimes negative usually worn quickly people interact never overt video game another story entirely even find foot online game ton overt discrimination never manage get something prove feel definitely experience talk also underestimate undervalue experience humanity soft science psychology background still come play even decade late find way make previous experience work never regret,women software developers experiences,0.924090385,,1,,,,,,

I will use the opportunity to share my partner's experience, though. That wasn't really a case of the technical team, but of the wider business, in a couple of forms:

1. The ""Can you put me on to..""s. When someone calls through to your department and requests to be put on to one of the developers. More irritation points when they persist in wanting to speak to someone else after being told that you are a dev.

2. The ""Bobs"". Name taken from office space. This would usually happen when someone was being introduced to the team (new higher-ups, or other new starters). They go around the team, introducing the developers, and when they get to you, the response is ""So, what do you *do* here?"". Bonus irritation points for ""Beauty and the Beast""ing it [(""It's a *girl* in the dev team!"")](https://youtu.be/mwtVunBOJzk?t=10).

The big difference between her situation and yours seems to be the team reaction. When she got the ""So, what do you *do* here?"", most of the rest of her team would say something to the effect of ""The same as us, only better"".

We were all a bit tipsy and just talking about dumb things that happened at our internships/part-time jobs/during tutorials and I just threw in a dumb tidbit about a male colleague being especially tone deaf on the existence of 'diversity hires' and some other disturbing ideas. I didn't want to specifically bring up the gender imbalance in tech -it just so happened that this 'dumb thing' that happened had to do with a guy with  misogynist views.

A friend of a friend piped up and expressed how sick she was of women in STEM victimizing themselves and alluding to women who find it difficult to break into the tech/engineering fields basically just needing to git gud. I honest to god thought she misspoke or the alcohol was doing something funny to my hearing because what she said was incredibly cruel. It even ended with accusations of girls in our group being hired 'just because they're a woman' from OTHER WOMEN who I would have NEVER guessed to hold such views. It then turned into a full on debate which many people joined and became very toxic.

I'm so shocked that so many women hold such internally misogynist views- there were people in that group who i would have never suspected. It disturbs me greatly that these are women who will be my future co-workers. I'm so disappointed in this lack of empathy and finger pointing.

Notes she's the only woman and only minority.",i6jebm5,"Just for the record, I'm in tech. I was an engineer, now an architect and engineering manager and I'm female. 

There are several AHs in this story. 

1. Your company. 

Your company's HR team or hiring process is clearly flawed. How in the world did they manage to hire a bunch of people who are not used to working with the opposite gender? Like, just how? The majority of engineers I work with all know how to work and respect the opposite gender and that's both within and outside of my company so there's clearly something seriously wrong with yours to hire this many, to quote your wife, ""fragile tech bros"". 

2. The ""fragile tech bros"" 

Need I say more?

3. You

Your wife is right. You've placed the burden on her and her appearance. What you should have said was that they clearly are getting used to face-to-face interaction after 2 years of zoom and try to get the others to snap out of it. If you're not the team lead, you should have reported to the team lead so this can be addressed immediately. If you ARE the team lead, well, you need to talk to your team members individually. Or talk to HR cause it sounds like all of your team members, yourself included, need some training. 

Also, ""exotic""? She's not a zoo animal. 

At this rate, you're going to lose your one recruit that I'm assuming is your company's attempt in trying to create a more inclusive and diverse team. 

The whole ""tech bro"" look irritates me. Because it pressures female engineers to conform e.g. jeans and hoodies and basically looking ""not attractive"". Since becoming a manager, I've decided I was sick of that look and dressed up more. Heck, the number of times I got mansplained or people just assuming I'm not the tech lead, not technical or just a PM - it was irritating as hell. I legit have been in a meeting and repeatedly said ""Talk to me, I'm the tech lead"" after someone asked who they can talk to to ask technical questions. It took my male colleague to jump into the exchange and say, ""Talk to her. She's the tech lead."" before it registered with the other party. 

OP - if you legitimately want to mentor this engineer and see her flourish, do some training around gender inclusivity. Perhaps your HR department can help (though judging from all your team members, perhaps not). Apologise to her and let her know SHE is not the problem. Have all your other team members do relevant training. Get her to present more at sprint showcases or team meetings. Pair her up with other team members to do pair programming. Setup more team bonding events e.g. trivia nights, hackathons. Have regular catch-ups with her to see how she's doing and if anyone is still making her uncomfortable. It's not on her to feel comfortable with the team. The rest of the team needs to make HER comfortable.

That might have been the soCal of it all. All the stereotypical problems with women being ignored and interrupted in meetings. We had to make MEETING RULES to include NO INTERRUPTING. 

One time my skip manager asked why we thought our team had lower job satisfaction scores than average. We said, probably the sexism, since this team happens to have the most women (out of all the tech teams he oversaw). He said well yeah, but I can't write that in the report. 

...

Well yeah but you can't write it in the report. Uh. Uhhh. ?

Lots of stuff like that. 

My position was a sort of limited product engineering role, maybe like an SME / developer using a variety of ETL tools and minimal scripting, but with elements of testing, design, data science. It was a weird job. But most of the software development engineers looked down on us as a general rule. (Broad strokes.) It often took on a sexist bent like telling women, you can do that job because it's not real software engineering, but you couldn't do my job because yknow you're just... naturally suited to product and customer facing work. Men getting promoted faster just shamelessly.

1.  Coworker sometimes raises stink when I evaluate his code and its, quite honestly, not good. I try to be nice about it, but there are some critical (but not personal or accusatory) comments in there such as ""xyz approach is not ideal because of 123"". I tell the coder I don't currently approve the code review and he gets boss involved and it turns into a huge retrospective every single time where I feel like I am being punished for what I feel like is doing my job. I could avoid this conflict by just approving everything instead of reviewing <code>.
2. My code often gets rejected for reasons such as extra blank line or I wrote if x and y instead of if y and x, where short-circuiting does not change the meaning int his context .  Additionally, when there is a stylistic disagreement, for example, I'm feeding a primary key into an ORM, it turns into a huge issue.
3. I feel like I am stepping on eggshells with code review comments, and if I disagree with <other senior> about <juniors> code, I get yelled at by <boss> or micromanaged regarding how exactly to type things in code reviews.
4. I'm doing architecture and backend-lead work but not invited to events with stakeholder. I dont have lead title on paper but the lead was pulled to do other work so there is no lead 
5. Title bait and switch by recruiters before tech screen. I have a gender ambiguous profile picture on LinkedIn and I clearly sound like a female over the phone. I will be contacted by recruiter for <job> with <title> and when I talk over the phone with them, they will tell me <title> is not available, but <title-1> is.  This happens extremely frequently, around 30% of the phone calls.

I have had other issues at other companies in the area (not my current company) such as people asking me out on dates, butt touchers, #2 at every company..  People kind of assume I am very junior until otherwise and may use words in conversation such as ""when I was a junior"" in order to imply that I am a junior. I have a degree in a top 5 university and about 7 years of professional experience.  I have a sr title.  I feel like the standard of what is ""acceptable"" in terms of the work that im doing is higher? .

Example:  I was one of three women on my team writing code. Of the three women I was the only one who was able/willing to be emotionally intelligent enough to handle the egos of my male (and female) colleagues. 

I grew up with a dad that had an explosive temper. Think Dr Jekyll/Karen.  He is super smart and respectful until something doesnâ€™t go his way and he would become verbally abusive and shame the person who disappointed him, often to the point of tears. Iâ€™ve gone to therapy and now I keep him at an arms length, but the skills that I learned to avoid angering him and handling his temper has helped me at work when my colleagues are disappointed or angry at each other. 

My project manager is a 6 on a scale of 1-my dad, temped wise. He will burst into meetings waving a ticket around like perry mason with the â€œgotchaâ€ evidence demanding an explanation for why things people told him donâ€™t add up. I have become his go to person because I sooth his mood, validate his feelings of disappointment, provide an explanation that fills in the gaps, and we always end meetings best friends again.

Iâ€™ve used my dad-gloves on just about everyone on my project and it has earned me the reputation of â€œThe Momâ€ on my project. For a few months I was the only woman in my companyâ€™s corps of engineers (until I hired more).  During those months my project became known as â€œthe successful projectâ€ since the male engineers didnâ€™t understand how to manage the feelings of upper management. Our project has disasters and fires and bugs, Iâ€™m just good at making people feel ok about them. 

My CTO has noticed this and he has straight up asked why Iâ€™m so good at handling my project manager and other egos on the project and I was honest with him about my up bringing. He has since tried to keep his ego and temper in check, he truly is a gem among men. 

Because of my CTO realizing my worth my company wonâ€™t let me leave. They keep throwing money and titles at me every year because I start hinting that I want to move on.  Theyâ€™ve now priced me out of the job market. Iâ€™m making double what I made last year, Iâ€™ve been promoted thrice in the past four years, and now all job offers I receive are a significant pay cut.  Iâ€™m actually not as educated, experienced, knowledgeable, or skillful as my male counterparts, but I can manage my managers better so I get promoted over them. I do sometimes bring this up, that they should promote my highly skilled coworkers, but my CTO says that they need to work on their communication skills to be worth a promotion.

You are going to encounter this, and worse, a LOT. Is it right? No. Is it gross? Yes. However you may want to take this as an â€œopportunityâ€ to learn how to handle it and tolerate this. 

There is a reason over 50% of the women that go into my field leave within a couple years. Its a 1 woman to every 10 men ratio - of course if you go into web design or something youâ€™ll have more women around but I digressâ€¦

Most of my job interviews in some way included a thinly- veiled attempt to ask me if I would report anyone on the team to HR. I am not exaggerating. You are seen as a RISK plain and simple. If a manager has an all male team, and theyâ€™re talking crassly to each other as part of a normal day - interviewing you is anxiety producing for that manager. No one wants to deal with an HR incident. 

So this professors comments? Yeah that is suuuuuuper mild amount of honesty about how most men are going to see you in this field.

Before I knew better, I almost blacklisted myself from jobs because I complained about some disgusting comments from a manager that were WAY out of line and frankly made me feel unsafe. The company response was to advise myself and that manager to never be alone together. That was it. He has three women complain about his sexism in one year and exactly NOTHING happened to him.

I've dealt with sexism working in restaurants and retail, and it was annoying and gross, but like those dudes knew what they were doing and knew it was wrong, were trying to get a rise out of me. That was much easier to deal with than the insidiousness of sexism that I've faced in technical settings, where they haven't the first clue that they might be wrong or hurtful when they say things like ""why not be an interior designer?""or assume that any woman wearing makeup works in marketing, not engineering. It's like this wall of ignorance that I just couldn't break down and fix even if I had the energy, which I don't. 

So here's the good news. Every technical woman faces this, and almost all of us are totally frustrated with it. Which means:

1. We are **so** supportive of each other. It's foxhole friendships, but by god, my network of technical women and queers always, unquestioningly has my back. We get each other jobs, we share salary information to make sure everyone's getting fair compensation, we mentor each other, we go for ""feelings coffees"" and vent, we volunteer for each other's favorite nonprofits. It's incredible. 
2. The women who survive the frustration are total badasses. When I got into programming several years ago, I was so impressed by how cool all the women I met were. Now I understand it's because to survive without losing your mind, you have to not give much of a shit what men think of you. Which means lesbians, autistic folks, and badasses do really well.

Also, career advice pls.",iddbt3,"Hello! I'm a software engineer with 2 years of experience now and have often noticed casual sexism at my workplace. There's no outright harassment or anything but the 'boys club' somehow gets the better projects, have inside jokes and there's casual remarks like 'oh no there's women in this call' or 'I've learnt so much from the juniors <goes on to list all the men juniors...only the men> or if they need input on something me and a male peer have worked on they listen to him and I'm talked over and so on (this may not seem like much as I remember only the recent examples but believe me they're pretty sexist).

When I joined there were 4 female managers and now there are none. Some were asked to switch teams because 'there were no opportunities' for her in the team, and another man was promoted to a similar position.

I've never felt like I actually belong in the team, I still feel like an outsider. There's always the inside jokes of the men. This, even though they'll call me a 'cool girl who's not like the others'. Because I occasionally smoke, drink, lift heavier or equal, can take a double meaning joke or two, will be up for playing a sport. Yet I'm not included. I do not appreciate the trope either but I'm still not invited to the after office hours parties because how will they discuss the women in the office if I tag along. And they constantly reference these inside jokes during common meetings and this pisses me off. They can discuss it separately when it's just them but no. They call each other 'bro' and it's all good in their hood but won't even make proper eye contact with us.

Is this the case for everyone? How do you deal with this? I feel like this is a toxic workplace and I need to get out of here soon.

I've been trying to switch but it's been frustrating. I feel like I don't know shit and I'm getting no calls from any companies either. I'm struggling with basic leetcode questions so even if I did get a call, maybe I'd just blow it anyway. My years here were rather unchallenging and I haven't learnt much and have forgotten whatever little I knew during undergrad. I let it be because I wanted to study further so the extra time helped me balance work and college applications. But due to covid, I've deferred my admission to next year and the thought of working another year here is making me very anxious. I'm trying to learn I'm trying to make up for the last 2 years but I'm still struggling with questions and the anxiety is overwhelming. Does it even make sense for me to switch considering I will leave next year anyway?

Any advice please :(

But there is a clear difference between the younger co-workers and the older ones, with the older ones harbouring a lot more unconscious bias and often acting differently around me, than around my male colleages (same level, roughly the same time in the group, approximately the same amount of experience). Some specific things:
- my male colleages on the same level do have little kids, I don't. They have a permanent contract mine is fixed term. I'm busting my ass and am working overtime while they are often strict on getting home on time to see their kids. Still I feel like the possibility for me to get a permanent contract is tiny, due to the fact that I might possibly get pregnant and might take parental leave (not that I'm planning on anything like that, but as long as I'm below 50 this seems to be perceived as a threat)
- Being talked over by especially older co-workers: I gave a talk for a group of visitors at some point, and one of my older co-workers (great guy, very knowledgable) answered the questions I got in the end, constantly talking over my first sentence. It talked to him later about this and he apologized and said he didn't do it intentionally, and I believe him, but this is something he wouldn't have done this if one of my male colleagues had given the talk.
- my demands being questioned a lot more than the ones of my male colleagues: When I want to spend money (say one of my people needs a laptop to be able to work more efficiently on a project) I need to negotiate much harder than my male colleagues. I resorted to have my male colleagues ask for the stuff I need if they ask for something similar for themselves. There is usually much less pushback and everything gets ordered much quicker. 
- collaboration partners going behind my back to my boss, if I flag something as a safety issue and won't do things the way they want it done (luckily my boss is with me on these kind of things, but it's still a huge pain in the ass)
- Sometimes I feel like my work is not being valued in the same way as the work of my male colleagues. E.g. I have to share my office with 2 other people, while my male colleagues have to share with max. 1 other person (we do have space issues, and it's not feasible that everyone has their own office). One time a new co-worker joined the group my boss wanted to put him as a fourth person in my office and it was incredibly hard to convince him to put this new co-worker into one of the offices with less people in them because he didn't want my male co-workers to feel too disturbed (same size office). I asked him if I'm not protesting as loud as the guys and threatened to become louder. 
- having to be the ""representative woman"": If there is some event, where the bosses want to make a good impression in terms of gender equality and so on, I need to represent and give talks more often than my male colleagues, since I am the only woman on that level. -> Additional work
I guess some of these things do have additional components, not only the gender part, but sometimes this feeling of having to be a lot better to get the same kind of recognition really pulls me down.",3282,feminine-coded goods and services,first say colleague openly sexist general feel mostly appreciate supported coworkers clear difference young co worker old one old one harbour lot unconscious bias often act differently around around male colleages level roughly time group approximately amount experience specific thing male colleages level little kid permanent contract mine fix term bust as work overtime often strict get home time see kid still feel like possibility get permanent contract tiny due fact might possibly get pregnant might take parental leave plan anything like long 50 seem perceive threat talk especially old co worker give talk group visitor point one old co worker great guy knowledgable answered question get end constantly talk first sentence talk late apologize say intentionally believe something do one male colleague give talk demand questioned lot one male colleague want spend money say one people need laptop able work efficiently project need negotiate much hard male colleague resort male colleague ask stuff need ask something similar usually much less pushback everything get order much quick collaboration partner go behind back bos flag something safety issue thing way want do luckily boss kind thing still huge pain as sometimes feel like work value way work male colleague e g share office 2 people male colleague share max 1 person space issue feasible everyone office one time new co worker join group bos want put fourth person office incredibly hard convince put new co worker one office less people want male co worker feel disturbed size office ask protest loud guy threaten become loud representative woman event boss want make good impression term gender equality need represent give talk often male colleague since woman level additional work guess thing additional component gender part sometimes feel lot good get kind recognition really pull,women software developers experiences,0.920481324,,1,,,,,,

Just a sample. But in general, the idea seems to be that (because I am I girl) I must not be as competent as my male colleagues.

I recently finished a fiction book, but there was part of the story where one of the main characters (male) is working in a small research lab with a professor and one other (male) graduate researcher.

Then the professor proceeds to micromanage her, and control parts of her job he has no clue about (ie, stare over her shoulder and tel her how to program, even though he doesn't know how), and berate her when she brings up issues with the research - blaming her for not knowing what she's talking about (she ended up being correct). She quits. The professor says ""See? The women never work out."". The research suffers without a competent programmer.

I've been to meet ups and hackatons where I'm clearly seen as a woman first and a developer second. It's uncomfortable, demoralizing, and a bit scary. I didn't have to deal with this at my job in such an explicit way (the sexism was more subtle), but it also told me to never fully relax with my colleagues.

If I were her, I'd also become more distant and coldly professional. One, because out of sheer uncomfortableness. And two, to try and maintain a professional relationship and avoid coworkers mistaking professional niceness for flirting or romantic/sexual interest.

1. Telling her they were just awkward because they were meeting in person for the first time, and some people are better at online chatting than in person, but to not worry, they just need to find their footing. ==> You place the focus/blame on your colleague's actions, which is what the real issue is anyway, not her looks or demeanor
2. Telling the guys to knock it off, remind them she's a colleague they've been working with together, and her appearance doesn't change anything.
3. If you hear your colleagues talking about her looks, how attractive she is, how they will have trouble focusing on meetings with, or anything related to any of this, nip it in the bud. Rince and repeat number 2 : remind them she's a colleague first, to stop focusing on her looks and to treat just like any other colleague.

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:33,2021-05-23 11:32,techthrowaway0523,Post,having trouble finding the right balance of soft and technical skills needed to keep advancing,nja3h2,"I'm about a decade into my career, working in software development in a very niche industry. Up until somewhat recently, I have been able to find a clear path to continue advancing my career, which I would like to continue doing - I am actually not necessarily interested in staying in deeply technical roles long term, and would like to position myself to go into director and eventually executive level roles.

I spent the early part of my career in individual contributor roles writing and maintaining software in my niche industry, then spent about two years in technical lead roles where I did everything from architecting complex greenfield projects to sprint planning to requirements gathering to code reviews to documentation to interviews blah blah.

Two years ago, I moved from being my engineering team's technical lead into my company's first technical product management role. All our stakeholders were internal to the company (important later.) This is when I started to run into trouble. I had a lot of credibility with the developers and got along very well with the director of engineering (who I worked very closely with.) However, over time I noticed important stakeholders seemingly intentionally excluding me from conversations that I needed to be in, then increasingly gendered things began happening, like someone would ask who was taking notes in a meeting, and a stakeholder would reply that I was doing that (when in fact, I was not, and I was in the meeting to participate in the workflow discussion aspects so I could tell the engineering team what to build.)

This continued to get worse, escalating into a situation where one of the problematic stakeholders had gotten together a group of other stakeholders, who were deep in dictating technical implementation details without anyone from engineering present (not their job or mine in that role.) The guy who organized it hadn't included me, but eventually someone in the group decided I should be there and invited me. When I saw what they were doing, I tried to pull them back to defining the problem statement rather than implementation details. The stakeholder who had organized the group became upset and verbally abusive. He later complained to upper management, who told me to watch my tone with him and that I would be fired if this stakeholder complained about me again.

A few months later, the director of engineering for the group that I worked with resigned. The CTO made a verbal offer to me to take on the role, which I asked to think about for a few days. Before I could say either way, the CTO called me and said that he had to renege his offer because the rest of the executive team said so. I would later learn that 'some of the stakeholders' had gone to the executives and told them that they didn't trust me to do the job, that I was not qualified to manage, hire and retain engineers, that my value to the organization was in 'organizing things and taking notes' and, my favorite bit, ""they were expecting a **different type of person** to do this job.""

Probably not a big surprise that I decided at this point to not work there anymore; within a month I had lined up a job at a competitor and given notice.

In my new company, I am back in a technical lead role where I have several peer technical leads. I am the only female tech lead. I should have seen this situation I'm in coming from a mile away, because during the interview process the eng director told me that they were really impressed with my soft skills, acted skeptical that I would be able to participate in code reviews since I was coming from a PM role (they use a language I wrote software in for nearly a decade...), and that I could ""rely on <peer tech lead> for technical guidance"" (I decided to interpret this as ""for technical guidance with our proprietary things until you get familiar."" Mistake #1.)

So I start this new job, and my manager (who is not the eng director, but a people-y manager from a non-dev background) sits me down like the third day to say that he's going to ""rely on me a lot for 'the people things' with the team,"" to which I said nothing because like, I'm brand new and I genuinely don't know what he actually means by that. I decide to ignore him and focus on getting up to speed with their tech stack.

It becomes clear there is no actual plan to onboard me and the other male tech leads begin trying to delegate their work to me because I haven't been given anything of my own to look after. I pushed back and essentially wrestled several areas away from some of them so that I had something to be actually the lead of.

It's still early days in this new job, but I am increasingly worried by several things that have happened already:

* I wrote an email to another part of the organization asking for clarification about some details of a project they were handing off to our team, which I cc'd my peer tech leads on because they needed those details as well. One of them chatted me privately and told me it was a ""great email."" Ya'll, I promise it was just a normal email. Dudes out there, do you send messages to other dude engineers complimenting their emails??
* I got asked if I would participate in a committee that is trying to improve our recruiting processes; I said sure I'll sit in to see what is going on. Oops, turns out this was a way for peer tech lead to hot potato recruiting / outreach stuff to someone else (he immediately peaced out of the committee as soon as I joined.) I should have said no but it's hard when you're brand new.
* I got randomly invited to a call that a peer tech lead should have been in as well, then told afterwards that the people on the call wanted to deal with me instead because of my 'superior soft skills.' The call was about something non-technical that is all our responsibilities to deal with.
   * After this incident, I actually sent the person who made the 'soft skills' comment the ""glue work"" article and explained to him that I would not take on 'soft' work that my peers did not have to do. He acted like I was being unreasonable, said it was part of my job, and insisted women being pushed into soft skill work ""doesn't happen here."" Thankfully he's not in charge of me.
* I wrote down some technical documentation that the junior engineers on our team needed to have readily accessible, because no one else had done it (ugh I know, oops). One of the other tech leads sent me a message complimenting it and said he could see I was a ""documenting type."" I asked him to not say that again.
* I genuinely don't even remember what the lead up to this was, but one of the other tech leads commented on how he felt that I was a 'more managerial' person and contrasted me with another of our peers, who was 'more technical.' He has known me for all of like two months, how did he decide that??

Generally I now have an incredibly low tolerance for anything I perceive as even remotely gendered.

* one of the tech leads couldn't believe that a project manager offered a 'technical answer' to a question and I told him that I thought it was unreasonable to assume that she did not know *anything* ""technical"" just because she was a PM (how does he know she doesn't do programming projects in her free time??)
* the tech leads interrupted / talked over another one of the project managers, so I interrupted them and said that I wanted to hear the rest of her thought (actually worked, yay)
* the PM wasn't available to run a meeting that me and another tech lead are also in; the other tech lead asked me to run the meeting. The next time she wasn't available, I very quickly told him that it was his turn because I had done it last time (which he did do, phew)
* one of the female PMs said something in a meeting; a few days later, what she said was attributed to me instead (only two females who had been on the original call lol), so I interrupted and pointed out that it had been her who said that information, not me

Basically I am refusing any 'soft' work unless someone can explain how it is part of my job and I see that my peer tech leads are doing the same work. I am also refusing to sit idly by during incidents of manterrupting and dudes declaring anyone else's value to be 'not technical'. I have even sent my male peers unsolicited articles about how women in technology get voluntold to do 'glue' work when they insinuated that I should do said work.

Am I being ""too extra"" in this new job? I feel like I'm carrying so much baggage from what happened to me at my last company.  I don't know how else to stand up for myself when people try to saddle me with work that I'm not interested in doing right now / didn't think I was hired to do, and to make sure that I actually have time / space to build technical credibility with this team (instead of getting bogged down in ""the people things"" that others keep alluding to wanting me to do.)

womenintech,hot,2023-10-24 20:18,2022-11-25 8:15,Impressive-Kale-9661,Post,Subtle Red Flags and BS Feedback at Job,z4d4pu,"Iâ€™m writing this in case it helps other women, esp. POC women, recognize potential, yet perhaps more subtle, red flags at their jobs in tech and tech-adjacent roles. This is also to bring closure for me on a past toxic startup job (PM). Note: I was fresh out of college when this happened.

- __Critiquing you on work that is not yoursâ€¦__ Yes, this did happen to me several times. For example, manager would give me feedback on how a Kanban board card/task was poorly written, except that I did not write the card. I had to point out the activity stamps on the card to him that I did not write the card: I was a stakeholder in the progress of the task and was asking for a status update.

- __â€œYou donâ€™t sound rightâ€¦â€__ A classic. This piece of â€œfeedbackâ€ was the red flashlight that went off, and I realized the ismâ€™s at play. Notice in my scenario, the â€œyou donâ€™t sound confident enoughâ€ was given in a way to make it seem collaborative. It may not be stated outright. I was first asked what I thought of my performance answering a coworkerâ€™s question on a call. I thought I did fine and gave xyz reasons. The manager had a look of reservation on his face. So I followed up and asked for his thoughts. He thought I sounded not confident and unsure. When I asked for clarification, he could not give any. The call recorded, so in about two weeks time I asked during 1-1 to listening to the call together. After listening to the call together, he actually said (without me even asking) that he actually thought that my answer sounded fine, perhaps he was mixing it up with a previous time when I talked. Notice that this a huge bias - your performance today should not be judged on your performance yesterday; otherwise, all instances of improvement are always invalid in this personâ€™s eye. It also helped with my case that I asked for my coworker who was receiving my answer for feedback on that particular interaction ahead of time. That coworker actually praised the thoughtfulness of my answer and how I followed up afterwards to make sure that my answer was clear.

- __Using very charged language.__ If you are getting negative â€œfeedbackâ€ that going something along the lines of â€œyou lack (xyz adjective)â€ or â€œyou did not (xyz)â€ or â€œyou seemed (xyz)â€, itâ€™s a red flag. First, ask for clarification if they can be specific about what xyz adjective means. Continue asking for more and more specific examples and specific actionable advice. If they cannot come up with either, itâ€™s not quantifiable and thus biases at play. If they can, consider if you can deal with this type of given feedback - these quotes come off as attack on your character rather than critique on your work, and that is not okay.

- __Invalidating your experiences.__ Need I say more? The way I got it was â€œmisunderstanding other peopleâ€™s intentionsâ€. Huh, interesting to receive this when I have brought up my words are often misinterpreted by others (which btw was brushed aside because the manager â€œhavenâ€™t seen that from others yetâ€ - well, yeah people act differently when different people are in the room. Surprise?). If your experience is brushed aside once, it will be continuously brushed aside.

- __Faced with higher expectations than others in your role.__ This one does not need more explaining but can be hard to document if there are only a few people in your role at your organization. Trust yourself. The burnout is not worth it.

- __Refer to themselves as â€œyour bossâ€.__ To quote GoT: â€œA dragon is not a slave.â€

*How to protect yourself:*

- Document everything. Document everything like you are going to court. The only way to get your point across when faced with a sexist and/or racist is to present cold, hard facts. Document your interactions, your works, contributes, positive feedback from others (do not be afraid to ask ppl you have a good rapport with). Changing a sexist/racistâ€™s behavior is close to impossible. However, documentation means you can escalate the situation either to higher up, HR, or just shove it all during HR exit interview. This things will come to bite said person. Be tactful and think about bridges, ofc. But also think about your own closure and wellbeing.

- Ask for actionable feedback. Make sure the feedback is specific: the manager should give your feedback that you can easily implement. If anything is unclear, push back. If he is not able to be so, red flag.

- Trust your instincts. Investigate your feelings. You feelings are always 100% valid. In these professional context, knowing how to voice your feelings distinctly makes a world of difference. Ask yourself what particular instance is bothering you. If you want to voice how a personâ€™s actions made you feel, focus on your emotions and the action. Do not let it come off as a pass on their character. Have specific actions they can implement or avoid doing to help you feel more comfortable. Again, donâ€™t have any expectations going into this. Like I said, it is close to impossible to change sexists and racists, but this can help if the other person did not mean to do so. Again, be tactful. Some men have very, very fragile egos, so Iâ€™ve learned.

- Look for the exit. Honestly, you may to able to change some things but not all things.

Current company probably hired me as a diversity hire. Iâ€™ve only received 1 minor negative technical feedback remark since I started and feel like Iâ€™m doing solid mid level work yet Iâ€™m repeatedly not acknowledged in person or on Slack. Like treated like Iâ€™m invisible and am unable to answer questions, help, etc. Been told Iâ€™m too opinionated. And also that I should speak up more. And stop being reactionary (I was only â€œreactionaryâ€ once) because itâ€™ll make me a better leader. But also told â€œitâ€™s just rankâ€ when I do bring up feeling invisible...Iâ€™m titled as junior at 5 years of job experience. And then an engineer coworker was starting to bully me and with this particular guy, itâ€™s highly likely itâ€™s based in sexism (heâ€™s made #notallmen comments amongst other things). Iâ€™ve never seen/heard him talk like this to any guys. He regularly also ignored me despite sitting on the other side of his desk. He also makes really offensive â€œjokesâ€. This situation just resolved with HR after months of inaction and gaslighting and after I escalated to offsite HR. I guess heâ€™s being punished because heâ€™s not at work and his tasks have been reassigned. Note: the bully went to HR first, not me. 

A male coworker has gotten credit for helping my manager and a lead even though I also helped (he physically showed them what I verbally said to do). That was also after my manager, who assigned me to the feature I was working on, failed to ask me for help and it was also about some code I actually wrote. I injected myself only because he was at coworkers desk next to mine and I overheard.

The only female senior IC on my team is looking at early retirement because she hates all of this. No one ever listens to her. She says this is the worst job and the sexism and bias feels worse than ever. She almost started crying last time we talked.

About a third of women (eng, qa, design) left the team since I started a bit over a year ago. Other women are also looking to leave, there arenâ€™t many left. Only female QA person has been learning to code and handles all the server QA yet she had to go to HR for help to be able to get a handful of QE tasks assigned to her after being rejected for the now recently filled QE role that she already supports. Her manager micromanages her to death even though sheâ€™s doing great work and provides so much value for what sheâ€™s being paid. 

Frequent dumb comments/assumptions like asking me if I have a nail file (why not ask in team chat), being surprised when I donâ€™t freak out about a spider on my chair, etc. Referring to my engineering discipline as â€œserver dudesâ€ when we have 4 whole women. These just get old.

Someone also reported something to HR on my behalf without talking to me and it destroyed my relationship with the coworker that was reported. He was at worst borderline unprofessional but I didnâ€™t have a problem with anything personally. He was super supportive of me which I never had at work previously and since then he withdrew from the team completely which is a huge loss because he is the type to push for newer, better things. 

Second day in this job at happy hour, a guy got wasted and hit on the female intern in front of me. He was really in her face and she was visibly uncomfortable. She escaped and then he started to do the same to me but I left too. Some other women on the team said this guy has done shit like this before. He has a girlfriend. I somewhat regret not saying anything to HR before. This intern was more welcoming than anyone else on the team and helped onboard me.

Iâ€™m early 30s and an analyst in the supply chain industry - so double-whammy male dominated â€¦ I just recently switched companies from a large one to a start-up and while the large company had limited women on the 200 person analytics team, on my new team I am literally the ONLY female and itâ€™s getting to me.

My direct team is actually pretty great even though theyâ€™re all male; however, the IT team I have to work with regularly has some unconscious bias thatâ€™s really bothering me and I donâ€™t feel comfortable bringing it up with my boss/coworkers because theyâ€™re not going to get it since theyâ€™re all males - Iâ€™m going to end up being the one whoâ€™s difficult to work with rather than influencing awareness of unconscious bias â€¦

Spent my entire time in one of the companies that youâ€™ve listed (not going to specify which one here, though happy to chat in DMs).

Iâ€™ve personally not experience direct, malicious sexism in my career so far. The closest to sexism that Iâ€™ve experienced (and keep in my mind that Iâ€™ve been in industry for a while) was one time where someone didnâ€™t know who I was and asked me if I was a PM. Iâ€™ve also dealt with (male) individuals that talked over me â€” however, they did these things as much to male coworkers (including those in leadership above them, oddly enough) where it was clear it was less of a gender thing and more of a â€œthis person needs to learn a communication skillâ€.  Overall, Iâ€™ve found the company that Iâ€™ve been at to be very, very good at supporting its female employees.  

By happenstance, Iâ€™ve ended up mostly on teams where I was the sole female, with the exception of my most recent team switch. While that is not uncommon at most companies, the fact that the sexism Iâ€™ve dealt with has been pretty minor (or has non-gendered explanations) has been pretty good. 

That say, sexism does exist in the industry. Iâ€™ve heard anecdotes from folks at at least one other of those companies that youâ€™ve listed (again, wonâ€™t name here, but happy to in a DM) talk about being told â€œah youâ€™re lucky you didnâ€™t join that other team you were thinking of; the engineering director had been blocking the promotions of the female engineers under him for the past 2 yearsâ€. To this end, you *do* have to be proactive in knowing the dynamics of teams and you *do* have to be careful about the teams you chose to join. However, there are also definitely clear pockets of good people. Seeing as how being deliberate of evaluating potential coworkers for fit is something good to do anyway, itâ€™s not too bad to add â€œgender attitude fitâ€ to the evaluation mix. 

FWIW: Iâ€™ve never heard of â€œsex partiesâ€ being a thing personally, though if they did happen, theyâ€™d be more at smaller companies than large ones.

xxstem,hot,2023-10-25 0:01,2018-09-29 23:53,[deleted],Post,Additional Expectations in the Workplace,9k37rw,"I had an awkward conversation with my manager this past week.  He basically told me that my company cares about diversity, specifically women in tech, and that they would like for me to become more visible in the workplace because there is an obvious lack of women in leadership roles.  He suggested that I touch base with one of our recruiters to discuss how I can play more of an active role as one of our senior tech members.

I was pretty involved in extracurricular activities when I first started working out of college. I helped organize hackathons, women in tech meetups (at the direction of our recruiting team), and organized other activities for our software engineering groups.  However, I quit caring about these activities when I became a manager two years ago because I no longer had enough time with my increase in responsibilities.  

Now that I am 32, I could care less about my image  because I want to settle down and have a family;  participating for these kinds of events just means I will have to put in more overtime and volunteer for work events that last the entire weekend. I already work a minimum of 50 hours a week, and I would rather spend the time with family, brushing up on my technical skills, or enjoying other hobbies.

My company has previously stated that they will always hire diverse candidates if they are qualified; even if there is not an open position for them.

I told my manager that I would find it deeply insulting if I was promoted due to my gender, and while he wasnâ€™t direct, he made a comment that the company is going to continue â€˜promoting people quickly.â€™

While I have not had my direct coworkers treat me differently as a woman, I know that other women software engineers have not had as good as an experience as I have.  Regardless, I feel like this kind of affirmative bias ultimately hurts women in the field because it perpetuates imposter syndrome (which I have), as well as create doubt as to whether or not someone has actually earned their position.

I guess this is just a rant.  I am passionate about introducing young girls to the stem field, but I do not want to be the â€˜tokenâ€™ female engineer.

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:37,2021-06-23 11:40,Paucidentomys,Post,Advice/validation - am I overreacting?,o6fdc1,"Hi, this is my first post here. Sorry in advance for the wall of text. I have been working for a company for about 2 years as a software engineer. Before this, I worked for another company for a year, and continue to do contract work for the previous employer on the side. I am the only woman out of around 12 engineers. For context, this is a very niche product, and due to the nature of the job, work is SLOW. Sometimes there is genuinely nothing to be done. People hang out at work all the time if there is nothing to be done. It has been this way for years.  Essentially, I am noticing a pattern of different treatment between myself and my male colleagues, and I am not sure if I am seeing what I want to see or if there is something going on. I like most of my coworkers, and no one (except maybe one) has ever said anything directly alarming to me, so I am second guessing myself. 
We use job grades, and because of contractual mandates, you can only be at one level for up to five years before the company has to promote you. One of my coworkers was promoted to the next job level. He has the exact same amount of experience as I do. Iâ€™m not saying he doesnâ€™t deserve it, but I feel like I am a better developer than him. In one-on-ones with our boss, he has told me I am doing an excellent job, and that I caught onto the entire system faster than anyone else. I explicitly asked to be promoted to the higher level a few months ago when I got a competing job offer, and was told no. Just no, not a â€œwe will reevaluate this in a few monthsâ€ or a â€œyou need to meet x requirements firstâ€ just no.
Background for this one, and looking back, may be alarming in itself. My boss pulled me aside about a year or so ago and told me that I needed to be more careful than the other engineers about what I do to â€œmaintain appearancesâ€ at work. He said things I do will be â€œmore noticeableâ€ than the other engineers. I feel like thereâ€™s only one way to really interpret that. So anyways, on more than one occasion, I have been with coworkers in the break room, or outside someoneâ€™s office, or in another location talking and hanging out for a bit too long. Yes, I acknowledge my wrongdoing here. However on every single occasion, I am the only one who gets in trouble and gets pulled into a conversation with superiors about it. The only one. Roughly half the engineers were there a few days ago, and I was the only one spoken to about this. I understand I am at fault, but why is no one else getting the same treatment? I am good at my job, I am over a year and a half ahead of schedule on my projects. Yes, you read that right. A year and a half. I know I am an asset to this company, but I feel like I am not being treated as such because I am a woman.

i believe i'm not in the wrong because after bad encounters with working with males in tech over the years, i've learned to share to people who i know are brutally honest and neutral and ask for their opinions on these situations, and they always agree that the other party/men on my team were in the wrong.

Iâ€™m a software dev (25F) working at a large company in the IT department for going on 3 years now, started right out of college...had no idea what I was getting myself into. I have never liked the people or the content Iâ€™ve been working with but the pay and benefits and stable job with good work/life balance in a large metropolitan area have prevented me from leaving thus far (although I am planning on getting out ASAP as soon as I finish my masters degree). 

Anyway, my manager said the same exact thing to me a few months ago. Threatened a PIP and implied I would face consequences if my performance did not improve. Iâ€™m convinced lower level management at large companies is absolutely toxic and the numbers always surpass the importance of employee happiness and mental health. Luckily Iâ€™ve been doing this long enough that they canâ€™t really afford to shuffle me to admin work, especially because Iâ€™ve been on the team the longest BUT if they had enough hands on deck Iâ€™m sure they would. I know this because this is exactly what theyâ€™ve done to another guy on my team but he has notoriously bad technical skills.  I donâ€™t really think thereâ€™s a big parallel to your situation though because you seem very competent and intelligent so Iâ€™m surprised (and also sadly not) that theyâ€™ve done the same to you.In a male dominated environment, I often feel like I have to do twice the work of my male colleagues to get half the recognition. I could go on and on about the ridiculously toxic things about my boss and my workplace, but I digress.

I've been really into STEM my whole life, but I've never had the opportunity to study it in a formal setting with it counting towards a degree due to hate. 

For my entire life, from the early 80's through the present, there has been a massive amount of bigotry directed towards women and minorities who are into STEM, and direct efforts to keep us out of the field/s, especially to keep us from making meaningful contributions.

My intellect is literally met with violence, so I have to keep it to myself.

And on the lighter side of things, if I go to a conference or meeting for developers, are my thoughts and ideas welcome? Am I welcome to speak, to exchange thoughts with people? Absolutely not. They look at me like I'm really stupid and say, ""I . . . work . . . with . . . computers,"" as if I would struggle to understand even that sentence. And if I say anything of substance, they just respond, ""You're amazing!"" and walk away like they're turning down a sexual advance. It's disgusting. 100% exclusion and dehumanization.

The same thing or worse in every area of STEM. All the time.

Does anyone take responsibility for this? Do they want to hear from those of us who read text books in our spare time because formal study was not available to us and who have ground-breaking ideas on important subjects?

No. Absolutely not. They want to treat us like children and give us infantilizing, ""You can do STEM!"" bullshit. Bullshit that's based on the assumption that we're scared and stupid and need something ""less intimidating."" 

It's all based on bullshit assumptions about women and minorities. They're insulting us and enforcing stereotypes instead of addressing the actual issues.

Every few years,  a new male intern or some fresh outta college, self proclaimed bro 10x-er decides he knows more than me. It usually starts as small backhanded compliments or arguing with me about humiliatingly simple ideas in excruciatingly round about ""holier than thou"" ways. I usually just let their hubris self implode their release schedule: ""ok, sounds like you don't need nor want assistance with this high severity security defect. Let me know when you resolve the code issue and are ready for release."" ... and then I block it due to an unsatisfactory resolution to the open vuln, letting them explain to their leader why they missed their target release date and refused my assistance. Even more fun if they raise a stink and I have to forward the email chain to their leader exhibiting their lack of cooperation and respect when I offered assistance. 


Fun side note: I usually dress very casual and somewhat gay (think flannels, button downs, hoodie vests, and addidas shoes) (fyi, I am gay so, yeah). But when I am meeting a new person or team for the first time I dress up in a cute yet smart business dress + cardigan (though still with addidas). I show up to the meeting 5 minutes early before folk show up and keep my head down into jira or the wiki, minimizing all my shell windows. More often than not, the other attendees assume I am a PM, and talk freely while we wait for the ""engineer"" to show up - sometimes their conversation includes some ""interesting"" and (rarely) insulting comments about dealing with infosec. Once I heard comments about how they wish they had one of the ""guys"" from infosec, as the women are usually late to the ""party"" and most likely just went to boot camp a few years ago. The look on their faces when I start the meeting 5 minutes in, introducing myself as the engineer... yeah, i fuck with the bros heads, keeps me entertained and keeps them on their toes. And the real bonus is that sometimes they are so embarrassed that they hopefully learn a good lesson about decorum and respect... potentially saving the next female engineer they interact with from their bro bullshit.


In my experience, women in IT have to work twice as hard as the men for half as much respect. Women have to be perfect and back their confidence up with cold hard results, where the men often get the benefit of the doubt. Also, I often have to be accepted as ""one of the guys"" before I have their actual respect, instead of them assuming I am capable based on my title and experience.

He's incredibly micromanaging, to the point I'm embarassed and feel very uncomfortable about the fact I've been doing things (including conversational things, like asking for help, or asking if others would work alongside me) on his requests (/orders) as if it's my own words and doing.
I believe others have picked up on me overly asking for reassurance and others input too, due to me being terrified to risk making any mistake - no matter how menial or small - and this has been very embarrassing at times also. And I feel it's affecting my character and reputation. I'm really not happy about this.

I really started to see things clearly as I've been doing way better recently, connecting with others on the team a lot more (where I was very withdrawn before) and being pretty confident and bubbly, getting work done, contributing much more in meetings, etc. And guess what's happened? He's got way worse. Criticism after criticism. Had a meeting where everything I said almost was responded to with something negative. It was unreal and really just very abnormal. He also questioned if I am capable of working when I am experiencing health symptoms (I have a disability, and I am capable of working at those times, decently so as well), made out I was being way too slow, and was clearly undermining my decision to work full time hours.

I'm good at my job, I'm really capable. I got really high up for my age when I was still very young. Previous manager called me ""one of the best engineers on the team"" - I was a 23 year old girl. Funnily enough, my first interaction with this guy, years ago, he undermined a suggestion I gave and it turned out I was right, also.

He invalidates what I say, my opinions don't matter or are actively rebuffed. He treats me with absolute distrust, and only seems to trust I'm not stalling on work and taking time for valid technical reasons when I'm working with another developer (interestingly, male developers thus far).

I'm starting to genuinely think he's threatened by me - which would sound way too big headed for me, but after reading about why people bully at work, and seeing the pattern of it worsening the better I'm doing, I'm starting to conclude that might be true.

Most of the advice I see online is to just leave. It's not worth the stress and health effects, etc.

I like this company and don't particularly want to be bullied out.

Also, as a women in tech, I'm tired. I'm so tired. It's not 1 company, it's a repeating theme. I've not had this level of targeted harassment before, but there have been plenty of other problems. I'm just so tired of it all. Is the solution really just to keep upping and leaving, every time the men start to treat you too shit? (Not to make it overly gendered, it just so happens most of this career is male so, not sure how much is gendered or if it's just people in general).

Open to any and all advice and experience.

This guy is a nightmare and it's making work really tough. I want to enjoy my job again. I want to be good at my job again without feeling this horrible stress hanging over me. I don't feel like I work for a company anymore, I feel like he just wants to control me via himself, down to way too many fcking details.

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:35,2019-09-04 12:36,cosmeticsnerd,Comment,Amazing thread with lots of badass women in engineering,eyzd2yd,"I'm a software engineer and I've had mostly positive experiences, with one glaring exception - a former coworker sexually assaulted me, but management/hr and my coworkers believed and supported me, and did everything in their power to make me feel safe at work after it happened, even though there wasn't much they could do about it officially since he had already left the company. I was fortunate, but there are ways to tell when you're applying for jobs whether a company takes women seriously, and looking for the green flags has made a big difference in my career.

When I've looked for jobs, I have always paid attention to whether they have women in executive and VP-level positions, and especially whether they have women in leadership positions on the engineering team. I've always chosen companies that had women at the head of the engineering department and (depending on company size) at least one other woman in a senior/executive leadership role. (The woman leading engineering when I started my job has since left, but half of the executive leadership team is women and a third of the VPs are women, so I feel comfortable where I'm at.) I really can't overstate how much this sets the tone and shapes the culture at an engineering company. If they aren't hiring women in leadership roles, it's a strong sign that they don't give a shit, because qualified women leaders are *out there* \- sure, they make up a smaller proportion of the candidate pool in engineering, but that's not necessarily the case when it comes to marketing, legal, product, etc. Even when it comes to engineering, the previous generation of software engineers getting their degrees in the 70s and 80s was around 37% women, and even when you factor in attrition from the field, that generation of women engineers is still 20-25% women. That's a much higher percentage of women than we're seeing complete computer science/software engineering degrees today (18% of new grads.) I'd consider making an exception to this rule for a brand new startup, but I'd have to be very confident in the leadership team to go for it.

I also ask about formal mentorship programs and processes for giving feedback to higher-ups at job interviews. I didn't have that at my first job and my career stagnated while I was there. At my current job, I have weekly meetings with my team lead and my manager focused on my technical and professional growth. Those meetings are also an opportunity to give *them* feedback on how I think they're doing. I've given negative feedback before (about how they handled a meeting, about feeling micromanaged, etc) and I've never been retaliated against. Mentorship has been instrumental in helping me work through stuff like impostor syndrome - there's nothing like hearing someone experienced tell me what I'm *good* at - and feedback being a two way street has also proved important for my career. For example, if a senior male engineer treats a more junior woman engineer with condescension when she asks for help, she should be able to tell him (or his boss) that his behavior was dismissive and disrespectful. I've been treated that way before and it can do a number on your confidence, and if there's no avenue for giving that kind of critique, ""little"" toxic behaviors like that just fester and erode trust.

Point is, if you love the work, I don't think you should avoid the field because of sexism in the industry. It's not rare, but it's not pervasive, either. No company is free of assholes - nobody I worked with had any reason to believe that the guy who assaulted me would do something like that until I told them what happened, and you can't assume that working at a company that supports women means that all your coworkers are trustworthy, but looking for green flags can give you a good (not perfect!) sense of whether a company is likely to support you or brush things under the rug.",3903,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

As a CS grad who has been in tech for a decade and software engineering for four years, I want to share a few secrets:  
1. Ninety percent of software engineers ""suck"". Just keep sucking and getting paid. Keep trying to suck less.  
2. There is no such thing as ""fitting in"" in tech. This industry still has a lot of gender bias. I've encountered some people who seem lucky and say they haven't encountered it, but that hasn't been my experience at all. There are also just a lot of tactless and strongly opinionated personalities. Start building yourself a support network ASAP. Gravitate toward people whose work you respect and try to learn from them. And, aggressively ignore everyone else. And, if your work environment ends up being full of assholes, suck all the skills and knowledge out of it that you can and then use it to get that next job as soon as you can.  
3. The only people that you need to please are your clients...and your boss, I guess.

What I post in next paragraph is a comment I posted on one of the stories here. Am reposting this here with hope that it will help other women who are reflecting on a similar problem.

I am not a biological female, but have worked with troubled as well as co-operative men in workspace. There can be male short-tempered or blindspot problem in developer communities. IMHO the source of the problem is upstream, men like Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman who have a record of snapping. So much so that Linus Torvalds pooped in an interview that he is not a nice person and from what it looks like doesn't intend to be. Unfortunately people look up to these men not just for code but also for interpersonal behavior. I think the solution to this is to first shape open source community to weed out hate/snapping/controlling type behaviors. Socrates did it 2000+ years ago in his community by sitting on streets of Athens and posing the right questions. One way is to create polls in developer's open source forums if you come across bad behavior from men in opensource or closedsource at school or workplace. Don't limit yourself to posting your experience on r/womenwhocode. If your fellow python developers display bad behavior, raise it in python forums too, it's very much a python profession problem. If people immediately around you cannot improve, it might at least inspire a better world elsewhere. If looking at python 24/7 cannot create better character, then its a problem worth raising in python forums. Take a look at my recently posted poll on inclusivity on r/zsh: [https://www.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/y9ayfy/poll\_on\_inclusivity\_and\_filters\_in\_zsh\_subreddit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/y9ayfy/poll_on_inclusivity_and_filters_in_zsh_subreddit/). Someone has to be really twisted to vote down on a simple poll on inclusivity. But there you go...

If you are less experienced, or have some other thing that might make you less valuable to to this visit than your colleague, well he's already going to have the colleague along, he's got sharp covered anyhow, and it's a good cross training/learning opportunity that would make you more valuable.

What I would do though, is dig in and fight for it. Betcha a lot of guys would do that.   Do not let yourself so easily pushed aside. Own your worth.

Say this all in a pleasant calm but firm steady voice with your head tall.   If he says any snarky jerky comments, do NOT let him see he's getting to you,  but ask him to clarify....like if he says we need something sharp.   ""Could you elaborate?

But the key is that it doesn't happen to ALL the women. And it happens more often to some men than others. The people who don't get that treatment (both men and women), know to stop an interruption, stand up for their own assertions, and not back down at the first sign of conflict. 

Also worth noting that the people who do this aren't always malicious. Especially in industries that are heavily focused on expertise and results, you get a lot of brilliant developers who are lacking in social skills. They still should be learning people skills, but that's an issue that has several much more effective approaches than treating them like they're being sexist.",839,gendered split perception,,,,,0,,,,,,

I actually get enough support for my tech career from my friends, colleagues, and managers of all genders that Iâ€™m privileged to not need a great deal of support otherwise and thus I donâ€™t really seek it out on Reddit. I do occasionally participate in subreddits that are relevant to my tech interests like cybersec or interests that tend to be dominated by nerds like me (mechanical keyboards, Star Trek...). 

I do also participate in some women-focused mailing lists and social media, but not heavily because I am more likely to have a discussion about being a woman in tech, for example, on Facebook posts with women who are already personally known to me and that I admire and empathize with. 

By and large, I use Reddit for the things that I donâ€™t have elsewhere because I have no mass of folks with the same struggle IRL or in my personally-known social media networks to connect with. Infertility and widowers are two of those subreddits that have a fantastic Reddit community and have been incredibly helpful to me. 

But also, I found some subreddits so toxic to women (including programmerhumor in the past although havenâ€™t checked it out recently) that I donâ€™t really feel like going in there. 

Iâ€™m old and Iâ€™ve been on Reddit a long fucking time (this being a more recent username) and I remember the Internet before Reddit and Reddit isnâ€™t special. Being open about being a woman on the Internet means in some cases that you have to be willing to abandon your usernames if youâ€™re getting too much harassment, and that you have to be picky about which communities youâ€™re joining or what battles youâ€™re going to take on.

Iâ€™d rather participate in only-sometimes-tech-focused subreddits that are focused on womenâ€™s experiences, are well-moderated and where I feel welcome, like 2xc, troll2xc, actuallesbians, ainbow...

The thing I can recommend to you is that you donâ€™t actually have to just go ask women to do the work of explaining our experiences to you specifically. If youâ€™re just now discovering that the Internet is hostile to women, whooo boy, weâ€™ve written about that a lot already from a lot of different perspectives. You can be a great ally by educating yourself. 

Read more books by women in tech. Follow women on Twitter. Read more about our experiences historically and whatâ€™s gotten better and in some cases what hasnâ€™t. Read about the experiences of trans women who get told things like â€œyour brotherâ€™s work was betterâ€ and the experiences of young women who feel alienated walking into an office for their internship or first job and being expected to join a â€œbroâ€ tech culture that subtly objectifies and denigrates femininity. Read about scientists having their own work mansplained to them, conventions who canâ€™t get women to speak because they invite harassers, cishet white dudes being upset that their favorite gaming convention banned booth babes or implemented a zero tolerance harassment policy because what if thereâ€™s a misunderstanding and they were â€œjust trying to be friendlyâ€. 

Reddit is not particularly notable in alienating women from some communities or letting communities that are overtly or subtly hostile to women continue to exist or flourish. It happens IRL and in all sorts of tech forums. 

From my perspective as someone who remembers vividly the days before having Internet access, the Internet is completely fantastic for connecting with like-minded people and for learning. And it also simply lets people still be people and a lot of them are jerks.

So, so much this.  If someone is a sexist asshole towards you, then they're a sexist asshole, and they would be a sexist asshole whether or not they're a sysadmin or an administrative assistant or a teacher.

I think the \*perception\* that tech is sexist is completely valid, because of statistics.  The tech field is very heavily skewed in distribution towards men;  this both increases the chance that a sexist asshole exists at all in the group, AND reduces the number of potential targets.  These factors combine to result in a very high chance that any individual woman being victim of this type of behaviour.  Professions that have historically been female\-dominated (e.g. teaching) don't have this problem for the same (but reversed) statistical reasons \-\- far fewer possible sexist assholes and a much larger target group, so the odds that any individual has to deal with this is significantly lower.

Everywhere I have worked, the developers / sysadmins / helpdesk / managers who happened to be women were treated equally, based on their merit \-\- except one guy who was an asshole towards one of our female developers.  I stepped in and had a.... ""friendly"".... chat with him, and that resolved the issue, mostly by him avoiding her for the remainder of their time there.",1397,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

 *Sheâ€™s a bright, talented young woman with an impressive story. Sheâ€™s also the only woman - and the only ethnic minority - on the team. I explained to her that she must understand that a bunch of pasty, nerdy tech dudes wearing T-shirts are obviously going to feel intimidated when their coworker is an attractive woman with exotic looks.*

Way to stereotype everybody- the ethnic minority woman on the team has ;exotic' looks? If she were white, would her looks be 'exotic' still? Nerdy tech T- shirt wearing dudes  who have never been around an 'attractive' woman?

 *The situation was highly awkward as a noticeable shift occurred. M is physically attractive and itâ€™s clear that it caught everyone off guard. At one point M asked to speak with me in private and so we did. She asked me whatâ€™s going on and why everyone is being weird and ignoring her. I explained that theyâ€™re a little intimidated and surprised but that itâ€™s nothing to worry about. She was confused and I explained that her appearance and demeanour arenâ€™t something the guys are used to. She asked me what that meant and I said that she looks great and carries herself in an elegant, respectable way.*

So the guys are being sexist towards M and it's her fault because she is attractive?

*After our conversation she seemed even more withdrawn and uncomfortable. Nobody else made the effort to engage with her so I made sure to include her. Ever since this incident M has resumed to being quiet at work. Our professional relationship hasnâ€™t changed but sheâ€™s clearly not warming up to anyone anymore.*

They are treating her differently because of her appearance (unless they couldn't tell she was a woman on Zoom). If they knew that she was a woman, why are they avoiding her now? And what are you / the company doing about it?

 *She insisted that I shouldnâ€™t have told M that her appearance was the reason everyone avoided her because that puts the burden on M. According to her I clearly made her feel bad and self-conscious. She also said that my team are a bunch of â€œscared little boysâ€ who would rather stick to â€œtheir little boy groupsâ€ instead of humanising and interacting with women. She said she feels sorry for M for having to put up with â€œfragile tech brosâ€ and hopes that this incident doesnâ€™t affect her confidence going forward. I explained to her that she must understand that a bunch of pasty, nerdy tech dudes wearing T-shirts are obviously going to feel intimidated when their coworker is an attractive woman with exotic looks. My wife rolled her eyes and said that Iâ€™m ridiculous.*

Listen to your wife. M can not help her appearance and she is being isolated from your team because of it. You need to nip this behavior in the bud and insist on the appropriate workplace interactions with the team. They need to learn to interact with all sorts of people and it's not fair to M to be treated this way. M is not the problem- the rest of the team is.

School is temporary and a series of hoops to jump through. Your career will be different; you will choose where to interview and work. 

If you need to go part time at school to have work life balance do it, but then increase the number of hours you spend practicing. 5 is not enough. Build portfolio projects that interest you, don't just crank out interview problems. Or get an internship at a good company with other women on the team -- that is a good sign of a positive work environment. Don't chase money, find a place that values diversity and respect where you can be mentored and build your skills.

Just take it one day at a time and work on what you can accomplish. You solve programming problems by breaking them into smaller problems -- that's how you need to deal with the challenges you're facing now. Compartmentalize and do one thing, then do another. Don't overwhelm yourself with the big picture. Do the best you can in the moment and let everything else roll off.

I was just speaking to an amazing engineer on my team today who has been a programmer for almost 40 years and he admitted to me that he thinks he is a bad programmer and struggles more than other people. He also said he has trouble in code reviews because he gets nervous. It is such a complicated field, and everyone feels overwhelmed by it (or should). You don't have to be good at everything, especially not right away -- just keep learning.

From personal experience, women who are doing fine in CS classes are more likely to think they are doing terribly and give up than their male counterparts. Don't fall victim to this mindset. And especially don't listen to the nasty comments made by men who are insecure and jealous.

I've read one too many times about sexist behaviour and networking practices in Silicon Valley. I've been wanting to read ""Brotopia""  by Emily Chang, that talks quite extensively about the culture of Silicon Valley - along with the mention of the infamous sex parties- and how it at times antagonises women. I've also read about claims of racism at various tech giants....

What is your experience as a  female in tech- pros and cons? Also, if you happen to be a women of colour( I am a black South African), what have been your experience with other male software developers in terms of race and also the aspect of a being a women too.

To end with the conclusion, you should be *immediately* working on leaving your job.  Your business sounds hopeless in a couple of ways, but more importantly, you're square in the range where people get fired.  You describe sympathetic responses from the PM (female?), but none from your boss.  Your co-workers don't respect you.  For example, the behavior of the senior engineer shows very strongly that they are routing around you.  If you had a personal career dashboard, it would be blinking red.

There seems like a very gendered response to you, in the sexual harassment and especially in how you didn't get work you were asking for.  But it also seems like you also significantly misread the local tech culture: work hours, expectations of assignment of interesting work, when to be self-advocating.  Is everyone else working more than 40 hours, or is it just your peer?  It seems very significant that a newly joined senior dev did your work on the weekend.  That sounds like startup intensity.  You imply that you were waiting for work to be assigned to you.  Is that actually how it goes there?  Some scrum/agile shops focus on developers grabbing tickets, some have assignments made by the manager. 

Here's an evaluation that you can do: grab 20-40 tickets done by you & your team in the last month, and look at them.  Are you doing only low priority tickets?  Are you doing only the low-estimate tickets?  Are your completion times in line with other junior team members?  (That's a trick question, since a no answer immediately raises the question: is that because estimates are assuming 50-60 hour work weeks, or are you literally slower than your peers?)  Are your tickets being bounced back from QA?  is your work receiving sharp but valid criticisms?  Any invalid criticism?  Are you missing any key deliverables inside the tickets?  Are tickets being assigned by a manager or grabbed by developers?  

I'm asking you to do this practice as a semi-objective X-ray of your local team's culture & practices.  It might point to gaps in your skills, but also to systematic misbehavior by your manager.  I'm also asking since this ticket review is not terribly different from how your manager might be evaluating you, e.g., with a stark comparison between your visible accomplishments and those of your peers.

The most startling thing in your story is that another developer forked someone's project and claimed it as his.  One way to read that story is that it's basic theft/plagiarism: the other dev should be fired immediately.  Another way to read it is that you're misunderstanding how much was changed in the project: you're not as skilled as you could be in looking at diffs, getting a handle on new projects.  Both branches are possibilities, and they're both very serious.  Consider digging deeper to understand this better, as it goes right to the heart of your own comprehension of your situation, as well as your company's ethics.",3027,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

[Chart and discussion here](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2015/01/10/chart-of-the-week-what-happened-to-women-in-computer-science/)

The short of it is that back when it was mechanical adding machines and slide rules ""computing"" was designated as women's work, because it's kinda secretarial, I dunno I guess.  

When programmable computing machines started to become important for engineering work, programming and operating them fell to women.  But home computers were marketed heavily as a father-son activity (many early ones were built from kits, like kit radios) and this lead to more young men going to school with some awareness of BASIC and assembly.  Then because sexism and laziness, schools confused prior experience with ability and didn't bother to accommodate novices.  So when the web bubble happened, it was mostly men getting rich.  A locker-room culture of acceptable sexual harassment emerged.  The gamer-to-tech pipeline solidified.  Women were and are further discouraged from programming careers by the reasonable fear that we'll be treated like crap.

Women are perfectly capable.  In my high school experience, young women were very much over-represented in math team and the top-track math classes, even though I went to a recently integrated school that had been all-boys only a few years previously.

I'm still seriously considering an engineering or engineering-tech career.  (Surveying?  Yeah, that sounds really appealing.)  But for me personally, overcoming a lot of misogyny, and ugly experiences with harassment, is *still* a personal challenge.  I'm not eager to generalize my experiences to women as a broad category - I'm trans and it was more often ""you can't be a girl because you like STEM"" than ""you can't like STEM because you're a girl"", but whichever way those prejudices slice I have become very much aware of them.  It's *amazing* what chauvinists will say when they think no women are listening.

Or I guess to state it more precisely: I started a career as a skilled repair worker and it was clear that I was expected to accept degrading and marginalizing women. (They treated bars and strip clubs as a kind of initiation ritual, for example.)  I was supposed to be ""one of the boys.""

Concerning the skills: I spent a long time at this job initially feeling dumb and worthless because this is how I saw myself. I am self-taught and now at it for 2+ years. Certainly I have tons to learn still, but I did see an enormous change in my perception of my own abilities once I decided to stop putting myself down and now I am proud of where I stand and can do. I can just imagine that working in that environment does not make you feel good about yourself, and your skills are probably better than you make them out to be. 

We donâ€™t do leetcode around here for interviews but IMO being good at it or not does not define your value as a programmer. I personally am not great at this kind of challenges but I am way more imaginative when it comes to other sides of the job compared to others that maybe rock such exercises. My advice would be build something you are passionate about or is fun to you. Create 1/2 side projects to show off your skills (or new skills youâ€™d be interested in exploring) and keep applying.

If someone is so weak that their imagination of being around men would cause them to balk at doing a job I say good riddance. They obviously wouldn't be able to handle pressure at crunch time.

Strawman, but I'll go with it. So what you're basically saying is, ""If you can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen""? I.e. if women don't like working in these male-dominated environments like software engineering, why don't they just go into nursing? 

I have a question- who does that help, exactly? Why is that good? 

I think it's worth it to ask two questions about the relatively small number of women working in STEM roles: 1) Why is that the case? 2) Is that a good thing that we should accept, or is there a benefit to trying to change that? 

Let's start with the second. The comment that I replied to suggests that it's in a company's best interest to hire the best people. That means that if you're the CEO and you want to hire the best programmers, it's in your interest to pick the best from among the widest array of possible qualified candidates, right? It would suck if a bunch of potential talent just wasn't submitting their applications at all, because they could've been really good employees. 

Okay, bear with me here. Let's pretend that for whatever reason, the software engineering field has a really strong bias against people who wear green sweaters, and this tends to cause green-sweater SW students to drop the major in their junior year for something else. Consequently, green-sweater students don't apply for internships. So you go recruiting at the local college and you want to hire the best interns. Well, you might get some great candidates who wear red sweaters, but doesn't it suck that you're missing out on a bunch of the green-sweater students who could've been good interns? I mean, it's pretty clear that you're not even getting applications from the entire pool of the best possible applicants, because the green ones didn't apply.

So you probably see where I'm going with this, but the point is- IF a culture were to exist across offices, or industries, or whatever, that systematically excludes certain groups of people (or causes them to drop the field as a result of said culture), that's totally a loss to you as the CEO, isn't it? And i'm also not saying you have to hire green-sweater people, that's obviously not where I'm going with this. I'm saying that having them apply in the first place is clearly good for you.

So saying ""Ahh you know, women just aren't wired to work in the dog-eat-dog software engineering industry"" is like saying ""Ahh, you know those green sweatshirt guys, they're just not cut out for programming, it's probably their biology or something."" And it's not just disingenuous and lazy to not look at the behaviors that cause the result, it actually sucks for you as the CEO.

> I say their imagination because how the fuck would they know your office culture is terrible just because there are more men?

I'm a guy in tech, and even I have to deal with so much tech-bro dick waving bullshit. This is a culture across the industry, not just on an office-to-office basis. Is it ridiculous to think that this might be alienating to women? And again, if so, would that be a good thing?

> Men = terrible?
 
I never said a thing like this.

> And if your office culture is notorious for being bad, or an ole boys club, its not something that will only affect women. So you have a much bigger problem.

Yeah, absolutely. That would suck. Culture in offices and industries that are harmful to anyone- men or women alike, should be addressed. So- wouldn't changing a harmful culture be good?

> And if she doesn't want to work in ""big tech"". So? People get to choose their own life dude.

C'mon man, you said this in bad faith. I'm clearly not saying that we should force women to be engineers and men to be nurses, and you know I wasn't saying that. I AM saying that it's be beneficial for both employees and employers to have choices and not be impeded by societal barriers, and that if those choices are being quashed down by certain behaviors or arbitrary borders or whatever, it's worth figuring out why rather than lazily chalking it up to ""Women are nurturing, men are competitive.""

> Most people tend to choose things that would make them happy instead.

This is so vague that it's not really helpful for telling us how to behave in society, but fine, let's say that we generally want to increase happiness. I think choices are something that would help make us happy. I'd like for there to be relatively little societal resistance whether I want to be a nurse or a software engineer or whatever without someone saying ""Ahh don't do that, that's a woman's job."" That would suck for me. Analogously, wouldn't it suck for a woman to hear ""Ahh don't be a programmer, that's a man's job, you're not really wired for that""?

> And that's exactly why it's women's own fault. Men are willing to eat shit for the idea of status and success, women are more content with a better work life balance to be happy. And that's their choice.

When making my decision, on the issue of gender inequity and diversity issues I considered :
- every industry has sexism, it just displays itself in different ways
- Iâ€™d worked in industries with decent number of women yet power and culture was still dominated by men, the inequity was subtle rather than blatant yet in some ways it made it harder to identify and point out, creating far more self doubt when trying to understand why things were unnecessarily hard
- looking at industries that have a high % of women, like child care or teaching, there is still systemic sexism of poor pay, limited options, and men entering these professions are fast tracked and disproportionately hold power positions. 
- even if there is a gender pay gap in tech and opportunity gap, the skills shortage and market rates mean Iâ€™ll earn more than & have more opportunities than in many other industries
- what is really important is to seek out the best in the industry, the companies that have a good workplace culture that will fit, and avoid any that send up red flags.

There is a world of difference between a healthy male culture and a toxic male culture. 

If you find a company that hires good people who treat others with respect, collaborate well, are progressively minded, you can have a good experience.

I am new to the industry, 6 months on the job, I am the only woman on my team and only really see women in department and company level meetings and events, or if there is a cross company initiative (workshopping company values, recruitment, etc). 

My team is great, really supportive, appreciate my contributions, and my tech lead has told me he thinks Iâ€™ll be ready for promotion to intermediate software engineer in a couple more months - thereâ€™s just one skill I have to learn and practice to get there. This will be quite fast promotion (9 months entry level junior to intermediate). 

I am not a person of colour so I canâ€™t comment on whether there is racism, however we have plenty of people in the company from different cultural and racial backgrounds, particularly in tech roles, and the founders immigrated as children from an Asian country.

The kind of gender inequity in my company is more about blindspots. Iâ€™d say pretty much all the guys would be of the view â€œit would be nice to have more women and better gender equalityâ€, they just arenâ€™t aware of how to address it. So decisions can sometimes be made without having female input, and stuff is more designed with men in mind. Like a go-carting team bonding event, having health/wellbeing sessions (run by an external company) run by a man who has a male perspective, some
decisions in recruitment that unintentionally lean in to systemic inequity (if prefer grad candidates with a tech degree, which are 80% male, will more likely hire a man than if open to bootcamp grads which are more diverse), men like to banter and joke/smack-talk each other.

However that didnâ€™t stop them from hiring me (Iâ€™m a bootcamp grad, and a woman) and the company does want to improve on this and has been open to my feedback. I started out self taught (which is a slow path!), then did a bootcamp. 

What is really clear is that as soon as you have experience in this industry, you can vote with your feet. The skills shortage means youâ€™ll have many job opportunities and if you are not happy with the company youâ€™re at, you can find a new job easily. 

On the topic of thinking outside the box and other qualities: Iâ€™d suggest writing down your wish list of qualities and then starting to research the companies that seem to meet them. This process will help when you are ready to look for jobs to find the kind of employer that will be a good fit. tech is more like an overlay than a pure industry, thereâ€™s fintech, edtech, health tech, etc - so there will be companies that are what you want, but there will also be others that still have all the problems of the corporate culture youâ€™re trying to get away from. Being able to recognise the difference will help steer you in the right direction.

Trying to start this conversation with firing 2 senior devs is a fantasy and it's painful to see how many comments suggest it.

I'm going to be honest, I didn't expect to have to treat the women on my team differently. I believed the other members of my team, as well as other teams and management would not or less treat women like anyone else on my team. My employer has a progressive EDI program, and a lot of woman leaders. I'll also add that the only reason I became fully aware of any issues is because the 2nd time it happened, the woman involved was a long time co-worker that I had specifically recruited. 

Back to the advice. Here's what I saw happening:

- Literally everyone cut her off. All the fucking time, no matter what she was talking about. I started keeping score. It was almost 7:1 compared to any other individual and 7:5 if all men were treated as a group. Holy shitbags. 

- She was automatically assigned project roles like ""meeting note taker"", coordinator, etc. If sandwich fetcher had been a thing, she'd have been assigned it. This was a team of 'progressive' dudes, it just kept happening. 

- She would be the last call for an opinion. Even on her own projects, or in her area of expertise.

Here's what I did (better or worse):

So, you have to be subtle. Being obvious reinforces negative attitudes about women in the workplace. 

- Be louder. When I saw someone being cut off, I'd cut them off and return the conversation to it's proper path. Sometimes you have to let someone go on for a bit, sometimes you have to be a little insulting about them cutting off others. 

- Work harder. I started making things like meeting note taker a revolving role. I spent more time working with project teams to level the field. 

- Show respect. Probably the biggest impact for me was deferring publicly to Katie's opinion or asking it in public settings. In fairness, I do that with all of my team now, but I feel that you have to highlight this for women on the team. 


This was hard to write. I've had women on my teams for over 13 years, and I still almost puke when I say I have to treat them differently. I made the mistake of trying to snowplow for women, and it got me a lot of accusations on the origins of any blowjobs I may receive. I made the mistake of ignoring the differences of men and women on the team, and it got me a fantastic engineer doing nothing more than making coffee.

My only criticism of the book is that most of the folks in the book aren't engineers, but that's natural as the writer was going for general women in tech, so there's a mix of engineers, PMs, admins, designers, and so on.

Personally I've had mediocre experiences so far, but am optimistic and switching teams soon. I wrote a bit about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/comments/jwfs33/experienced_female_developers_having_experienced/gcqq0ye/), but the most relevant part is

It's been disheartening to say the least.

I put together a team of programmers that was 50% male and 50% female, and *never* felt like I compromised on ""skill"" for ""diversity"". I just made finding a diverse set of *applicants* a priority. These men don't know what the hell they are talking about.

1. They feel like *they* don't deserve their position. They are projecting. This is really common in tech, it's called Imposter Syndrome, and you will also experience it regardless of gender at some point.
2. They may be good at their technical field, but if you're at the ""internship"" level, your co-workers/peers (and you, honestly) know fuck-all about what goes into hiring. Trust me, there's virtually no company that is willing to hire the worse applicant just because they have a vagina, or have dark skin, or something like that.
3. Even if you *were* less qualified, all of tech is a collaborative, creative space that requires problem solving. This is *vastly* improved by having a diversity of perspectives, experiences, and personalities on the team, so that a wider variety of solutions and problems can be considered. It is possible that you could be the more valuable hire *even if* you were less qualified than someone else (which it doesn't sound like you are).
4. For a lot of companies, the problem isn't that women aren't as qualified, it's that they can't get as many women to apply. This is the part that requires conscious effort towards diversity on the part of the company, but if it's an internship program through a University (which it sounds like here), then the company doesn't even have to do that. Even so, for me the most difficult part was finding a variety of applicants, *not* having good male, female, minority, etc. applicants to choose from.

You deserve your position. You know why? Because you have it.

Because tech is still seen as a 'passion' field. And nobody cares about training, everything is just 'teach yourself'. I got my first computer at 16, I didn't even know CS degrees existed and after uni I fell into a technical role by accident but every single day I feel I don't belong here. It's nothing to do with my team, they're all amazing and supportive despite me being the only woman, and the youngest.

\- Everybody's story is 'I started coding when I was 10 blah'

\- Constant talk about video games, some new technical thing, nobody really discusses normal topics.

\- No training, you're expected to 'learn everything' by yourself unpaid and everyone around you already knows what they're doing because they spent 20+ hours tinkering on the weekends.

Now these things in isolation are fine! In fact from an unconventional background I wouldn't have made it without my weekend work, as we speak I'm keeping an eye on my pipelines. But the general MESSAGING is that tech is a thing only for those obsessed with it who 'fit the mould'. You can't be here because you're reasonable good at it , want to make decent money and generally want to go home at 5, live your life. IMO those who WANT to surge ahead, fine, but constant grinding to the detriment of everything else shouldn't be an industry norm.

I do a lot of outreach events, for interns/grads etc the majority of women even those who do CS/Engineering end up going into PM, tech recruiting or similar roles after a couple of years in the job because of this. It's hard to battle the imposter syndrome. FWIW I genuinely love all of this, if I wasn't tinkering around I'd just be reading books so it's not like I'm sacrificing a brilliant social life. But I'm starting to question whether it's worth it. Especially after kids somehow the mental load always falls to the woman anyway you get further and further behind.

If you want to attract more women (or anybody who's unconventional really) - the main thing you should highlight is your support for technical pathways. Training people at work time costs the company, as opposed to just hiring those who will happily put in huge amounts of time at home. Companies already short on devs expect new hires to be productive. By contrast nobody would ever let a junior doctor loose on patients, or a junior accountant loose on financial statement production without a lot of handholding.

Also if it's female technical staff you're after make sure you highlight them. I've lost count r.e. the number of times I've turned up to D&I events and every 'woman in tech' was a project manager, HR staff, or similar. It's like being an accountant for a tech firm and saying you 'work in tech' erm no admin/support roles have mainly been women...",2829,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

I actually read about this responding to another redditor. For example:

""Between 30 and 50 percent of programmers were women in the 1950s, and it was seen as a natural career

one of the Navyâ€™s few rear admirals in 1986, about 37% of computer science undergrads were still women

By 2011, the percentage of women in computer science programs had fallen to 17%""

That redditor said that this is because of women's lack of interest but failed to mentioned that women were basically pushed out. 
So then the articles mentioned what happened and I think the main reason is that the male programmers didn't want to be in a career with lots of women because they knew they would make less money so by pushing them out they can increase their pay rate. 

""What changed? Well, male programmers wanted to elevate their job out of the â€œwomenâ€™s workâ€ category. They created professional associations and discouraged the hiring of women. Ads began to connect women staffers with error and inefficiency. They instituted math puzzle tests for hiring purposes that gave men who had taken math classes an advantage, and personality tests that purported to find the ideal â€œprogramming type.â€ Frink writes:

According to test developers, successful programmers had most of the same personality traits as other white-collar professionals. The important distinction, however, was that programmers displayed â€œdisinterest in peopleâ€ and that they disliked â€œactivities involving close personal interaction.â€ It is these personality profiles, says Ensmenger, that originated our modern stereotype of the anti-social computer geek.

Employers began comparing programming less to clerical work and more to masculine activities like playing chess. Ad campaigns criticized women as gossiping, time-wasting, and error-prone. One tagline for Optical Scanning Corporation Ran, â€œWhat has sixteen legs, eight waggly tongues and costs you at least $40,000 a year?â€ Your team of 8 female programmers, thatâ€™s what.

Hiring mangers began administering aptitude and personality profile tests that were biased toward men. The answers were circulated to fraternities and menâ€™s clubs like the Elks.

One of they key takeaways of the personality tests was the best programmers were antisocial, and that that was a male trait""",2592,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

- friends at work to commiserate with and have your back. Sometimes theyâ€™re men even. 
- prioritizing a diverse working environment. IME places seem to be pretty good at this and attract better people or pretty bad at this and attract losers. Maybe sometimes youâ€™ll be only woman on a small team but the team should not all be white straight men. 
- remote work can help. Stuff still happens but itâ€™s easier to take a break in the middle of the day to decompress from a hard moment or turn down the volume on someone who irks you. 
- if a place is bad, move on. Thereâ€™s so many opportunities, thereâ€™s no need to stay places you donâ€™t like. Yes the next place might also be bad, but at least youâ€™ll probably get paid more. 
- donâ€™t waste your time trying to teach or fix people. Preserve your energy for people who deserve it. Build up your allies. If someone says a bad joke at your expense the silent treatment or just the word â€œwow.â€ can often be as powerful as nagging why itâ€™s important not to make fun of women in tech. People will try to ensnare you in ridiculous arguments about the various reasons there arenâ€™t more women in tech, try to get out of it. It depletes you to have these conversations over and over again with men who have no idea what they are talking about. A lot of them are purposely trying to get you exhausted so they can say â€œgotchaâ€ and win an argument. If you never play the game you never lose it and you save your strength for the games that matter. 
- write down any interaction that feels off. Take screenshots of anything that feels off. Write down and take screenshots of good moments too. Keep a brag sheet. Maybe youâ€™ll never need any of this but itâ€™s good to have receipts. 
- prioritize having an outstanding manager. Someone who can help sort of protect you from difficult people. Who comes in with the assumption that of course youâ€™re up for promotion and is looking for evidence for it. Rather than someone who thinks you have something to prove.

I agree with the others that the employer has a huge relevance here as management should come down hard on this type of treatment. I do not think this will change without the pioneers to show other women that this type of career can be fun. Throughout the years my employers have actively sought women but don't receive the candidates. When I talk to the women in my life they pro\-port zero interest, however I can't help but feel that they are afraid of the type of environment you describe. The only way the ""male"" culture stereotype of I.T. will get busted is by showing a growing majority of women participants. 

I relate to some of the statements you made. This career type attracts people that focus on things in such a direct way that they can't see the big picture very well. Autistic tendency is a joke on forums but I know personally many I.T. workers who fall into this category. Unfortunately the deeper into this spectrum you are the more difficult it is to be empathetic and realize how what you are saying or doing is affecting others. In no way do I want to take away from your experiences here as a woman as those comments you report are disgustingly inappropriate. I do want to mention that some of what you discuss is just plain offensive to another human regardless of gender and is commonplace in this field. 

Just because you think someone is wrong does not mean you get to dismiss them. You should always treat a person with respect and when mistakes are made find where they contributed or helped. This is not common and even in this sub\-reddit it's a common theme of berating incompetence and heralding ""doing things the proper way"". This black and white mentality is caustic and leads to the inundating stress that causes people to give up the field or as we've seen in previous posts even as far as to take their life. 

This is a generalization and therefore inaccurate in some cases. I still find that male culture especially in the workplace suffers from a lack of openness. Males typically express how their co\-workers make them feel. Males typically avoid showing weakness and so hurtful banter is commonplace. This lack of feedback means the caustic behavior can manifest without threat for years. I think that has been extended to you and this is where your voice can improve the lives for men and women alike. My point here too is that you are a unique and capable individual. You are not only a token woman braving the obstacle of sexism. Your analysis, your opinions, your solutions are valuable to the rest of us out here. We want you, We need you! on our side to do the kind of thinking and acting that evolve the field in a healthy way. 

I implore you to keep going. Look for your like minded peers. The kind ones, the polite ones, the re\-enforcing ones. Ditch a company that doesn't cultivate an environment that attracts these people. The future men and women of this career need you to lead the way. 

Thank you for your determination so far and I personally hope you keep up the good fight. ",3129,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

After working in engineering for years, I was interviewing for a position where I would be essentially in a tech support role supporting other engineers using a specific program. My company had other women in this role before and were very much aware of the biases women face in tech. They approached it compassionately and asked if I had ever felt like I had faced unfairly as a woman. They were being so gentle beating around the bush about how they asked that I almost cut them off to stop the awkwardness and assured them that yes, I had and while sometimes it happens I don't let it get to me. (Partial lie. Truth is I just don't let it get to me while I'm still at work). 

They then asked me how I would respond if I took a call on a question I knew I could answer, but the customer was insisting on talking to a male support engineer. I answered that I would assure the customer that I would be more than happy to answer their question and that I was very confident I could resolve their issue, but if they would rather wait for one of my coworkers I would be happy to take a message and someone would call them back when they become available, but that I could not make any guarantees on how long that might take. 

They seemed very happy with that answer, and followed it up by assuring me that they do not tolerate abusive customers and that if it can down to it they would be more than willing to fire a customer in support of a support engineer who was just doing their job. 

This was a very refreshing interaction and made me feel very much at ease with the idea of joining this particular team. They indicated that they knew what bias I'd likely face which at its onset would be out of their control, asked me how I'd respond, and then followed up with how they'd respond if needed.

I love materials and chemistry but figured out (before I graduated thankfully) that I wouldn't be able to work long term in a lab. My experience in IT has been largely positive. Many of my coworkers were/are wonderful people that I very much enjoy working and collaborating with. I had one really, really crappy manager, but I think that was just because he had absolutely no business being a manager. Most of my problems have actually come from the people I help. When I worked as IT Desktop Support, I definitely delt with people who take issue with a woman helping them fix their computer problems. I've gotten pretty good at standing my ground and not letting them bully me, but I do have boundaries. In my current company, I am fortunate that my managers never let anyone get away with bullying or talking down to us. If I ever felt uncomfortable, I just forwarded all communications to them and they took it from there. I've never seen a situation end in anything other than an (actual) apology from the person, from low level devs to our chief legal officer. Having competent and caring managers is the thing that makes or breaks roles for me. If I have a manager who stands up for me and doesn't tolerate sexist behavior from anyone, then I've been able to grow and learn and really enjoy my job.

I would highly encourage anyone to pursue any sort of engineering if it interests them. It can be a highly fulfilling career. But it is a lot of work so trying it half-heartedly won't cut it. There are so many roadblocks still and people who will try to push you out if you let them. I had a great support system of my parents, my partner, and my friends that got me through 5 years of engineering college and two layoffs, but I still had moments of ""Why am I doing this?"" Then I'd go to my lab class that day and get to pour molten metal into 3-D printed sand molds!!! (It is a super cool experience, I recommend it to everyone) You have to find the things that ignite you and remind you why you fell in love with engineering in the first place. And you might have to keep doing that over and over until you find a place where you don't have to go looking for that spark, a place where the spark finds you.

You came in there hoping to learn, and you can't provide as much value as a mid to senior level software developer, so the best thing you can do as a junior is to be open to learn, show you are engaged, communicate well, respect everyone around you, and be professional and mature.

But now you see that the overbearing male who pushes himself into everything is eclipsing your professionalism. 

I don't know what to say to you other than this is what we talk about when we say tech is always heavily biased towards men. And at the end of the day you can't control your manager's bias, they chose the male.

What you can do is to start analysing how your CV would look with this internship's description on it, and focus on the projects that are available to you that give you better material on your CV. At the end of the day you don't really want to work for the company, right? So make the most of the internship as it is, and better luck next time.

Another thing is that just because your manager doesn't give you programming projects doesn't mean you can't ask the non-tech people you work with if they don't need some help automating tasks, and then write some shell scripts for them, and add them to some company repo. I don't know if this is possible for you within the limits of your internship.

All i can say is I commiserate. I was an intern in a company where 2 male developers got ""downgraded"" to tester because they couldn't handle development, and the other male developer got fast-tracked to a senior engineering role which he couldn't handle either and ended up being a senior doing config work. Ultimately I was the only female and was capable of  handling whatever they threw at me, and got nothing but shitty engineering work and management not listening to what I said I more interested in doing.

But I took whatever experience I could and moved onwards and away. These male managers cannot see their own bias, even if they're nice guys. They just cannot see that they automatically prefer and reward men and see women as simultaneously useless enough to not be given technically high-visibility work, but useful enough to be give equally complex but low-visibility work.

However, you're probably going to have to deal with it because the culture at your company is unlikely to change. The way I see, you have three options.

**(1)** Do nothing and just accept it. It's not your job to fix their culture, and if they want to be fucking stupid and inefficient, sucks to be them. It's not a reflection on you or your technical ability.

I was also a software engineer, and for just as long (longer, even). I never had these experiences. I'm not trying to dismiss or invalidate OP's experiences. I don't doubt OP one bit, and it totally sucks. No one should have to put up with that BS.

However, I wish people wouldn't make sweeping statements like ""his word will _always_ be believed over yours"". If you find yourself in a situation where these things are true, you should leave. Don't settle for a job where your co-workers/management don't respect you. Better jobs are out there.

Respectfully, if at every job, you think people are dismissing or belittling you because of your gender, you should take a step back and ask yourself if you're contributing in some way. Hard truth: Maybe sometimes the problem isn't your gender, but your work or your people skills. It's like the old saying ""If everyone you meet is an asshole, you might be the problem.""

I turned my hand to whatever needed to be done for a successful project, whether that was architecture or dirty work. Sometimes, it was both. Be a team player.

I mostly worked with and for men. Sometimes there were jerks or people I didn't like or bad managers. Sometimes my opinions were respected and acted upon, sometimes they weren't. That's real life. It happens to men, too. Most of us, male or female, are just there to do the best job we can at delivering the software. Who has time to care about what's between your legs?

But that is mitigated by how the company views women in tech and the process of balancing their work force.

I quit my job in the middle of the pandemic to do a full-stack dev bootcamp. 

I was apprehensive, knowing I'd be going into a mostly male workforce where I previously worked at companies that were all women besides IT and management. 

One of the things I made it a point to ask during interviews was about their diversity and how they are improving it. 

The company I ended up with after 6 months of searching (I'm 1 of 2 female developers out of like 25. project managers, marketing and design are 50/50), answered that they are not where they want to be. When they started the company 3 years ago they reached out to their network which was white dudes. They have more difficulty finding women with 10+ years of experience cuz they know the industry was not kind on bringing women in until more recently. They are focusing on developing women early in their careers. To bring that mentorship and growth so that they can help as many of us as they can afford to have a first positive experience in tech. They also pair with a bipoc women in tech program to offer internships and career development. That started last year. I'm excited to work with our new intern this summer.

I happen to be older than everyone (including my boss) except 2 people in our local office (half are remote out if the country) and I don't know if it is cuz they are a late 20s crowd but they don't seem as set in their anti-women in tech ways that I've seen in older teams I interviewed in.

Anyways. Their initial attitude and understanding of their lack of gender diversity, helped me make my decision. Additionally they have a very clear system for promotion and bonuses, so I'm not worried about being overlooked. 

I've only been here a couple months and it takes me a while to form friendships. If I was working with all older dudes I def know that I probs wouldn't be making close connections, but I think in time I will be able to form connections with my male and female peers hopefully.",2151,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

I don't know if I were an actual engineer if the energy would be bad, but I lucked out. Mostly I think it is due to the culture as a start up, the management have daughters my age so there's always that lens. Also my coworkers have healthy relationships with their moms and sisters and those who have wives. They mention them in passing in positive light. I am not joking, and it's so weird? But it's great too because they're open about it. That might be a green flag to look for? 

I'm not harassed here by anyone and lucky that my manager and former manager (shifted roles) takes that seriously. But I'm excluded. Because even my friendly coworkers are filtering what they say around me and it's not awful things but like using the word bitch for example. I'm never invited outside work events and how would that go? They still like bars and ""everyone"" knows how risky that is even if there are no predators among my coworkers. Also I was point blank told that I was the only woman in the office and the first one to join. 

That aside I think and hoped we'd recruit a female engineer, so I don't know maybe the pay is too low. Like, it'd be a great place in terms for her to learn. But we only had male applicants even for my role when a coworker quit. 

I was also the only female student for electronics though.

Mentioning this as a possible time for you to look elsewhere and maybe pros and cons of a start up environment. But at the same time, I know how rare this is too. My friend who works at a company corporation is having the full experiences of being a female in tech specifically the computer science majors / types (not being taken seriously, out numbered, excluded, bad jokes even not of her but ""females""). 

knowing and seeing prior work places poorly handle sexual harassment or enable it in minor ways was really scary for me to even consider the field.

I had also had to come to terms (at a point in my life not now) when I wanted to enlist in the military and the rape statistics. As well as women in blue collar trades.

I rambled a bit, but like I said to my friend in tech, I love learning from her. Not just how to handle crap, but the cool shit she knows! I compare to to when we didn't have female doctors, females in military, and now female in STEM.

If you're burnt out still lookout for yourself when you leave. Like what benefits can you max out? Gives you time to plan. Like, not everyone can tough it out ""forever"". Every single trades woman I spoke to told me they ALL had the 1 awful experience that made then reconsider the trades. It broke some. There's nothing wrong with leaving. You can't hurt yourself to be a symbolic role model even if you truly are.

I heard there's a female only repair shop in Oregon I think? That is run by only female trade workers.

I'm rambling,. But like, unlike the near past. I think we as a whole are finding or making our own niches. We do the work we do because we're passionate about it and we are able. If your line of work morphs into something adjacent I hope you find it instead of quitting flat out.

There's a line in the handmaid's tale like ""don't let the bastards grind you down"" or something like that.

I don't know. Personally I love finding and seeing real females in roles. Like wow. You're real! I actually said that to a trades woman and she looked at me like I was crazy, but she understood. She said in her 4 years working maybe 4/300 union trades workers she met were female.

I know you're not in the trades, but the similarity of ""is it worth it to put up with this anymore?"" rings true over there too.

I hope you do what is best for you. Not because some assholes ruined something you enjoy. Who are they to do that? Sometimes it makes sense to think like that. Other times it doesn't.",3860,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

I'll add an addendum: I found that a different question works better than the design review one. Instead, I now prefer to ask:

* Suppose it's 6 months into the future and you are holding a meeting to brainstorm ideas for future work from the team, including all the engineers. What kinds of inclusion and equity issues might arise in that situation?

This is flat out me testing them on their DEI knowledge. If they do well, I might follow up with ""and what would you do to mitigate those issues?"", although it's likely to come up during the discussion a bit anyways. Basically everyone can get

* There are some people who tend to talk more than others and they might dominate the conversation

Congrats, they figured out something that might hurt the majority group, big achievement /s. What I really want to hear includes:

* People in positions of power, and especially men, will tend to talk more than people not in positions of power.

* Especially if the discussion is free-form, men and women will tend to interrupt women more than they do men.

* When women and people of color interrupt or disagree with others, they tend to be more harshly socially penalized than men and non-POC.

* If women or people of color point out any unfair treatment, they will tend to be viewed more negatively than a majority group member doing the same. This is compounded with the fact that people in the majority group or positions of power tend to notice exclusion and bias less than people not in those groups.

* Some people (ex. introverts) might be more comfortable generating ideas when they aren't in the middle of a group discussion and therefore have a reduced ability to participate.

* People literally listen less to under-represented groups than they listen to people from the majority group. This can lead to things like ideas that are repeated but presented as new.

* Remote participants are at a steep disadvantage in free-form discussions versus people in the room.

Mitigations include:

* Add structure to the discussion, don't let it be a free for all.

* Have a moderator.

* Train people to notice and intervene when there's bias affecting a meeting.

* Send an agenda and idea prompt out a day in advance.

She thinks that leveraging the Spring Boot framework is an intermediate Java skill. She says that it's fair to ask coding challenges and in particular they believe a OOP challenge is fair and relevant. In other words while she may know what leetcode is, she was asked what is essentially a leetcode easy question on their interview. She has passed an entry level tech interview (in which the bar is quite low compared to L5) which was additionally made easier for her. She has never passed a tech interview with the kind of questions people refer to when talking about grinding leetcode questions for interviews - questions that are more along the lines of competitive programming and while certain topics may be relevant to the specific team, there is seldom a team that needs all the topics that are fair game to ask (every section of CTCI), where candidates need to practice 300+ LC medium and hard questions where the answer is compared to past coding competition winning entries, stuff that if you pulled a current employee who hadn't been interviewing for a year and asked them the question, they have a high chance of failing themselves. My conclusion is that she really agrees with you that some level of relevant challenges are reasonable, she just either doesn't have any idea about a true LC grind or she is deliberately obtuse. The latter wouldn't be shocking either as her post history is 70% filled with the type of things you would expect a junior dev with a case of survivor bias and no sense of nuance to say. Your comment was that the several weeks long investment needed to grind 300+ LC medium and hard is prohibitive for some women with other care duties, and there are other ways to assess competency, she didn't seem to comment at all about that specific challenge and instead either jumped to some weird defense of women's technical abilities due to wanting to defend women or because she wanted to point out that she was asked *something* technical at her interview and thus everyone else shouldn't be able to complain about the relevance of any kind of technical question.",2262,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

I am a year away from finishing my career and I could say many, **many** things about it. Thus, I am going to stick to the important stuff:

* It's not easy. But most of all, **it's not nearly as impossible as everyone wants you to think it is**. I can't count the times people have looked at me as if I was a no-life socially awkward nerd, and it is so far from the truth, it's honestly frustrating at this point. I believe every career is hard in its own way, and failure is always around the corner, in every aspect of life. That being said, it is true that it's a career that I don't think anyone will have a good time coursing it if they are not passionate about what they study.
* Which leaves me to my second point. **It is a field of study that generates passion**. Sure, there are always subjects and areas of engineering that you will find tedious, obsolete, and maybe useless; but those that you get to enjoy are so incredibly worth it that even if the road leading up to them is bumpy, you can't even begin to imagine what awaits for you when you find *your* place inside the field.
* I see many responses talking about the **satisfaction** **and sense of purpose** that this field brings to those who study it. I can only say it's 100% true. I am from Argentina, and in spanish, ""ingeniero"" stems from ""ingenio"", which can mean ""inventiveness"", ""creativity"", ""wit"". An engineer is not a machine, and does not operate a machine; an engineer creates solutions, invents new and efficient ways to solve problems, and improves those solutions that are already in place. I think many people forget about the *creative* part of being a software engineer, and only associate the word with typing complex *algorithms* into a computer everyday. This is not what we do. We make things work, we create new and innovative tools for society to work better as a whole.
* I started working 7 months ago, while still studying, and I have to say that I love going to work everyday. The work environment is awesome, the pay is great, I feel like I am needed in the company... I am overall really happy with my job. What I'm trying to illustrate is that it is an extremely rewarding area to work in, and that there are so many job offers and demand for software engineers that you can **choose who you work for, what you work for, and for how much**. For some, this is all they need to be happy, and for most, it is at least 80%.
* Finally, I think I can't finish this comment without saying something about the **lack of women software engineers**. It is a fact, it is notable (very), and it needs to be improved. However, I may have been privileged, but I haven't encountered many issues with my gender in regards to my field of study. In fact, everything seems to have started shifting towards ""gender inclusion"" in companies and therefore, I have felt slightly benefited from being a woman. A ""female quota"" is not something I personally approve of inside a company, but it is a way of trying to balance things out, until a time comes where hiring women software developers is not seen as ""weird"" or ""abnormal"". I think this shift in society's views on women is something we can take advantage of to get the best we can out of an unfair situation. **Do not be discouraged by your gender. Own it**. I make a point of being bold, vocal, and super hard working, thinking about setting an example for women developers everywhere that says we can be (and we are) as needed (or more) in the industry as men.

Thank you for reading my rant, I am very passionate about what I do. If any of you have more personal questions (or just more questions), curiosity is always encouraged, and I will be happy to answer them via DM, or here in the comment section.

Ye gods, I remember these meetings, when I was a very young software engineer / technical program manager, doing a lot of cross group coordination. I was very lucky that my first couple of groups were very supportive and helped me get off on the right foot.\* And I learned how to stay completely poised and non-hostile while making it clear that no, I'm not an intern that wandered in by accident, I'm the technical specialist you're supposed to be meeting.

...and being good at it doesn't mean it's something I should have to do. (I also got very good at putting men who tried to grab my boob into joint locks, to the vast amusement of my team.)

(And each class a number discover that they absolutely adore coding, and it goes on to change their plans in a major way.)

My students ask a lot about my background both in industry, and about earlier days in computing, and I've referred a number to internships through friends of mine. Talking about culture in industry is... complicated. I turn a lot of appalling incidents into humorous anecdotes - not because they're funny, exactly, but because adding some humor makes it a bit less awful to hear. While still making it clear that this is absolutely not okay, and talking about some of the strategies I've used in those situations.

Before I started cybersecurity, I was a network engineer. And under all of the IT umbrella, in my experience, that one is by far the most male dominated. Way more than software development even. Even when I was in college studying for it, there were all of two female students in the eight semesters of those classes that I took. The college part wasn't bad, but once you get on the job...well...Being a network engineer was a fun job, but the egos behind most of the coworkers I've had are through the roof, and it was just pissing me off.

While I'm about as cishet male as they come, I've also got a very bad case of impostor syndrome, and when it comes to the workplace I'm extremely conflict averse (on the street is a different matter, but I won't get into that.) So whatever men do to you to push you around, even when you're in the right and they're not, they tend to do the same thing to me.

Now prior to this, I had an interest in cybersecurity, but no education within it to speak of, so I never got involved in it, until the place I worked at started building out its cybersecurity team. And one thing I noticed is that, unlike with the rest of IT, actual people worked in cybersecurity, including a female director and half of the analysts being female. I had the chance to get a few free certifications, so I took it, and quit that job and went elsewhere to work cybersecurity.

At this new job, guess what? Female director, female senior director, 2/3rds female analysts. All normal people. Over time, one of them retired and the other quit to work somewhere else, and they were replaced by a male director and senior director. Despite that, nothing changed -- we remained culturally the same as a team. Everybody gets along great, no drama to speak of. I eventually quit that job to take a massive pay increase at another place, and while the team is much smaller here, we are more male dominated here but still have some female teammates.

Cybersecurity, by the way, is quite broad. Some people go into it from being help desk, some as system admins, some have law degrees, and some have CS degrees. As you advance through it, you can easily move into one of the other domains of it if you want. I personally started as an analyst, and over the three years I did that I picked up software development skills, and now I'm a software engineer within the cybersecurity domain.

I can't say enough good things about it, particularly if you want a change from the typical IT bullshit. Your experience will vary, but I'm just suggesting you consider it if you're as annoyed with bro culture as I am.",2653,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

It's not malicious it's just that you have to prove yourself to everyone all the time constantly, because it's competitive and you either know your shit or you don't. 

Eventually I'll reach a high level of respect once enough of my work is published, but I think from women I talk to they assume it's way easier for me than it actually is. It's not like all the boys treat me with the assumption I understand what they're talking about, frequently their scientist-y lack of social skills leads to them saying shit that's offensively condescending.

She had this sense of arrogance and entitlement like I have never seen before; she was extremely soft spoken so I didn't pick it up at first. She was the most junior on the team and everyone made it a point to make her feel welcomed and offered to mentor her whenever she needed help. She always complained about not being heard so I went out of my way to add agenda items to carve out time for her to share her input (she still didn't feel heard). She complained about not enjoying the work she was assigned so I moved mountains to assign her to the projects that SHE had asked to work on while other team mates graciously picked up and complete her half baked projects. She couldn't deliver on the project she hand picked and blamed it on the project being stupid. She complained about not getting opportunities to understand how the batch process worked so I, again, found opportunities for her to learn how to run it during business hours in a test environment to minimize risk.

The overall rant was taking issue with being treated differently from others on the team and I donâ€™t think was directed at a person like you, who has a general process of â€œletâ€™s run through the steps that were takenâ€ when you apply that approach universally.

I do get where youâ€™re coming from with your analysis but I didnâ€™t interpret the example the same way. The thing is, with the exception of a few insane women who are irrational or hate men anyway, many women are hesitant to complain about sexism and to jump to conclusions so weâ€™ll observe our coworkers to see if itâ€™s â€œjust in our heads.â€ So if â€œDannyâ€ always wants to doublecheck our troubleshooting, for instance, weâ€™ll watch to see if he does that to anyone else. Weâ€™ll casually bring it up over lunch with someone else, â€œhey, Danny is real meticulous, right? He likes to reassess from the beginning a problem, right?â€ You try to suss out the situation so that you can confirm, no, no, heâ€™s only doing that to me. Then you start doubting yourself and thinking that heâ€™s doing it because youâ€™re terrible at your job. And then your boss throws you a â€œgood work on xyzâ€ as you pass him in the hallway but 15 minutes later Danny slides over to your desk with a â€œhey, you know, Iâ€™ve been thinking...â€ and essentially tries to tell you that he disagrees with your approach on abc. If you look back at OPâ€™s rant, this is the overall gist of the rant but she attempted to provide specific examples of why she knows that itâ€™s not in her head. Many women are agreeing with her experience because this is a shared experience down to the self-doubt and feelings of helplessness due to the continuous need to prove yourself over and over. So I donâ€™t discount your perspective and explanation. My own experience just allows me to see it differently and to distinguish you from the men that OP is complaining about.",2364,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

They come in with all the knowledge from their tiny projects in university, and don't see the complexity and social politics between every system that has been successfully built and is running.

Of course she dismissed your concerns saying ""I don't think this is a concern"" you're dealing with someone who has no clue of what the real world is like. I think you are very kind to spend nearly 2 hours reading her homework, and then taking it seriously, but I would not take it seriously.

I see this happening more frequently the more that women are in tech. Usually the male juniors come in with their arrogance and the male devs just ignore them. In this case because you're probably one of the few females it feels more difficult and thorny to get around because there is so much problems and disrespect around what she's doing in the first place, and it's a highly sexist field so it could be used as ammo by anyone who would like to.

Don't rethink anything just because of a junior who didn't take the time to research anything before giving here non-expert opinion. You know exactly why choices were made at the time, she doesn't. This is the way things go in tech.

She should learn quick enough, hopefully she  steps out of her lane again to ""helpfully"" criticise someone who isn't as nice as you are. She'll stick her neck back in.

I agree with everyone else, if it comes up again ask her why she wrote it.",1439,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

He was an equal-opportunity asshole who was outright abusive to everyone he encountered. I work in an industry where yelling and cursing is very normal, but this dude went above and beyond and would even get physical sometimes. One day his focus landed on me, and though there was no sexual/gender element to his abuse, it was behavior that needed to be reported.

It turns out dozens of people had reported this guy, but I was the first woman to do so. Even though I made no mention of sexual harassment or gender discrimination in my report (because there wasn't, if anything this crazy dude held back a bit since I'm a women. At least he didn't  physically push me the way he did some men), but since a woman made the report, all the lawsuit alarm bells went off. There was an investigation where all the other reports that had been swept under the rug were brought to light, and many other employees were interviewed. The company's fear of a sexual harassment lawsuit finally forced them to deal with this asshole.

I was amazed by the positive outcome! The hostile guy was put on leave and sent to anger management courses, and he totally cleaned up his act. When he returned to work there was no more shouting, cursing, slamming, throwing, or pushing. His face would turn beet red and you could see his jaw clenching and veins throbbing in his forehead, but he controlled his behavior. I would have never believed it possible that a person of his age and position would put in the effort to change, but he did.

Also the HR director for the division was fired, most likely for failing to take action on all the previous reports. 

There are so many stories about women experiencing retaliation for making harassment reports. I completely expected this to happen to me based on the overall toxic work environment at the company, but nothing bad happened. I made the report, got called in a week later for a brief interview with HR people from outside the division, and that was it.

Granted the guy I reported was a cartoonish rage monster, which is not the norm for harassers, who are often much more subtle. I just wanted to share my surprisingly positive reporting story. Being a woman actually helped in this situation, and I am proud that I used my powers for good. 

My experience in general, though, is that women are not believed when they report a problem. There has to be a lot of documented behavior for corrective action to ever happen. If you report the behavior, even if nothing is done to help you, you are laying the groundwork to help another woman when she inevitably encounters the same problems, or his behavior gets worse because there were no consequences for his original transgressions. 

That being said, as much as I am all about women supporting women, you have to do a risk assessment of your particular situation. What is the worst possible outcome? Though the behavior you are describing is relatively minor (for now), retaliation can be very outsized compared to the report. Depending on your position in the company, how long you have worked there, how well established/respected you are, what your supervisor/boss is like, you may or may not be able to withstand the retaliation. Even if you can deal with it professionally, how will you do emotionally?

Reaching out to Reddit will get you some great information about a wide range of experiences, but it will not apply to your company.",3525,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

Our take:  
YTA, you've made unnecessary and psychologically harmful comments to a subordinate.  Instead of taking responsibility for both your inappropriate response to her and your lackadaisical expectations of your team, you've doubled down and put all the onus on her. 

This could have been a teaching moment for your insular group of ""pasty, nerdy tech dudes"" to learn how to respect their colleague and grow as people. A teaching moment *you* should be leading. Instead your comments and lack of action has created a hostile work environment.

That is certainly a fresh breathe of air compared to some who immediately jumped into insults the moment your point does not match theirs.

For instance I had someone PM ""F**k you!"" 
So i respond ""I am sure that you are a very attractive men/women but I am afraid that I will have to decline your offer as I am taken .Happily married to a beautiful wife with 2 kids.""
To which he/she respond with ""Yea right you incel Go die in a fire"". 

The level of our conversation are just so on another level as you can see. I feel so sad that a man of my position making the money I do get this kind of insult that I am thinking of buying that AP watch that i have been considering for sometime now to make myself feel better. But since that will be the 3rd luxury watch for myself this year I think my wife will not be happy about me spending that kind of money.

With regards to your experiences here is what I have to say. 

I started my engineering career as a junior level exec and personally I have been through what you are describing. I can tell you honestly you are not the only one or the only gender facing this.  And witnessed the same happened to my friends male or female.

Many people in any working environment or field neglect the power of working on their people skills or soft skills. 

And this is especially a difficult skill to developed since you are in an Engineering field. I can say with some certainty that people in this field are not those that you will ""party with"" as it takes certain character to enjoy doing Maths and solve complex problems. 

This trait is worse in the older generation, as many of them being ""old school"" are often set in their way. But we deal with them because they are effective, hardworking, and overall good worker. Though personally I do think they need to work on their people skills.

They tend to be direct with anyone male or female and tend to not hold back,  whether be it offering criticism or tell you how they think you are stupid and cannot perform.  They are ""straight forward"".

I can see how you will take it personally if you have been confronted by these type of people as you start working. 

My personal experience. I was a newbie engineer responsible for the setting up of a new machine where upon completion I was to passdown to another department who will proceed with the calibration and loading of software to said machine. 

After passing down, about half way through the day I received a call from the engineer in charge. The first word I heard was "" What the f**k were you doing are you retarded"" without specifying where the retardation is.  And for a while after that he specifically told my manager he refuses to work with me as I am incompetent. 

If you are interested I could share other numerous experience I had. Fun times. 

We eventually do get over our differences though and he trust me enough to show me professional respect. Well...  He has too. I'm the VP 

Working environment can be difficult to navigate since the cultural differences of school,  where you can expect to find many support,  and work,  where if you are unlucky you can expect shit to be thrown your way. Many people including me find it daunting. 

Having been through the America schooling system when I started my career I was shocked to find out what working life is actually like.  These seemingly rude,  crass,  uneducated people are actually my superior!??  

When taking my Masters the majority were so professional.  Now working many seems so unprofessional.  Unbecoming of someone who might consider themselves an engineer. 

If you don't have thick skin it can easily affect you.  Trust me when I say just because you don't see it doesn't mean they are not being obnoxious to the male staff too. 

About the part that you find your superior reholding information from you that is surprisingly rather common. They have something you don't.  Be it knowledge, or a skill,  or the ability to be more effective in their work. 

Some people think that keeping info or a skill set to themselves makes them more valuable and indispensable when retrenchment come.  Not to say it is right or wrong but it is what it is. 

They see no need to help you or give you the information for free. Seeing as you are just a work mate and not a friend. 

My advice to you is work on your people skills,  have thicker skin and grind if you want to stay in our field. 

I say this to people all the time.  When your colleague are being shitty to you, understand that they are being shitty not to target you.  But they are doing so for their personal advantage . You just happens to be in their way. You need a certain level of enlightenment to be able to understand what I am saying.

Don't take what they say personally,  though I will admit that is easier said than done. Learn to focus on the point rather than the tone of the delivery and do what you need to do. This is what you need to get higher in the field,  which I find many youngster lack. 

This is a problem because people who are usually very good at their work and can teach you a lot don't like to beat around the Bush and take nonsense from anyone. They tell it as it is. Many young people are simply not thick skin enough to benefit from these ""experts""

Someone in my position is actually taking the time to tell the things as it is,  no political correctness and people are triggered because of my tone or whatever. 

Just look at reddit where the majority users seems to be of the younger generation.  Anything triggers them,  anything is micro aggression ðŸ˜‚. Must be a racist,  sexist,  or whatever ist because blah blah blah. 

It's hilarious to me honestly. I like reddit especially because it's so easy to trigger them. Just look at my post histories. Instead of attacking my points they goes straight to personal attacks. And nothing they said gets to me because simply of my status. What is better than to trigger people when you are having a stressful day at work? For me, it's almost priceless. Something you cannot buy with money.

But back to our topic at hand since you are in an engineering field you can make a decent living being what we senior management call a ""farmer""- you do the same thing day in day out and get the predictable compensation for your work. 

I don't care too much to police my tone so I am sure there will be things you find offensive. But if you want to climb and progress in the field think over what I wrote. 

I sincerely hope I can help someone to advance professionally.  Though judging from how the reddit crowd is I wouldn't bet too much on it. But I hope at least you will benefit from the wall of text which I made an effort to write.",6733,feminine-coded goods and services,,,,,0,,,,,,

There can be male short-tempered or blindspot problem in developer communities. IMHO the source of the problem is upstream, men like Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman who have a record of snapping. So much so that Linus Torvalds pooped in an interview that he is not a nice person and from what it looks like doesn't intend to be. Unfortunately people look up to these men not just for code but also for interpersonal behavior. I think the solution to this is to first shape open source community to weed out hate/snapping/controlling type behaviors. Socrates did it 2000+ years ago in his community by sitting on streets of Athens by posing the right questions. One way is to create polls in developer's open source forums if you come across bad behavior from men in opensource or school or work. Don't limit yourself to posting this on r/womenwhocode, if your fellow python developers do it raise it in python forums too. If people immediately around you cannot improve, it might inspire a better world elsewhere.

As I'm sure you're aware, women are a pretty underrepresented group in the computer science / engineering world. Finding a handful of companies that have purely female engineering teams or even half female is going to be a pretty tough ask.

I think your best bet is to find a company that is really invested in diversity and inclusion. Specifically around women and other minority groups. The benefit of finding a company who really cares about making sure women are represented on their engineering team is that you can play a big part in helping build out the future of the engineering team (to a certain extent). And then begin to surround yourself with good humans who you enjoy learning from and writing code with.
