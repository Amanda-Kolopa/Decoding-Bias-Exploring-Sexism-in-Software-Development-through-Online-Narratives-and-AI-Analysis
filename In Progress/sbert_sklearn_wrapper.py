        "The experiences when women software developers are expected to naturally provide to men because they are "
        "entitled to receive the benefits of womenâ€™s goods and services. Moreover, these characteristics are used to "
        "reinforce traditional gender roles. For example, care-mongering is when women are disproportionately "
        "required to be caring and are expected to develop personal relationships with individuals. For example, "
        "I am the only woman in our dev team and I am always implicitly expected to do the administrative tasks "
        "during our meetings. When I confront my team about this, they explain that my organization and note-taking "
        "abilities are a natural talent that benefits the team.",

        "Women software developers experience harsher judgement when performing the same actions as their male "
        "counterparts even though they have done nothing wrong in moral and social reality. Women may be subject to "
        "moral suspicion and consternation for violating edits of the patriarchal rule book. For example, as a female "
        "software engineer, I feel like my source code is heavily scrutinized by my male teammates. When I submit "
        "similar work as my male co-workers, I tend to receive more critiques compared to my colleagues despite our "
        "work being identical in logic and performance.",
    '3':
        "Arises due to systematic biases that afflict women software developers as a social group that has "
        "historically been and to some extent remains unjustly socially subordinate. The group members experiences "
        "challenges as being regarded as less credible when making claims about certain matters, or against certain "
        "people, hence being denied the epistemic status of knowers For example, I am a woman software developer. I "
        "find that when I present an ideas to my development team, they often ignore my input. However, when my male "
        "colleague repeats the same ideas in a follow-up meeting, the team almost immediately accepts them.",
    '4':
        "People are (often unwittingly) motivated to maintain gender hierarchies by applying social penalties to "
        "women software developers who compete for, or otherwise threaten to advance to, high-status, masculine-coded "
        "positions. This is experienced when women in such positions who are agentic are perceived as extreme in "
        "masculine-coded traits like being arrogant and aggressive. For example, as one of the female programmers in "
        "our team, I sometimes experience a sense of hostility when I provide constructive criticism or potential "
        "improvements to my male counterparts' source code. I give the same type of feedback to my female colleagues "
        "and receive praises."
