        "required to be caring and are expected to develop personal relationships with individuals.",
    'gendered split perception':
        "Women software developers experience harsher judgement when performing the same actions as their male "

        "moral suspicion and consternation for violating edits of the patriarchal rule book.",
    'testimonial injustice':
        "Arises due to systematic biases that afflict women software developers as a social group that has "
        "historically been and to some extent remains unjustly socially subordinate. The group members experiences "
        "challenges as being regarded as less credible when making claims about certain matters, or against certain "
        "people, hence being denied the epistemic status of knowers.",
    'social dominance penalty':
        "People are (often unwittingly) motivated to maintain gender hierarchies by applying social penalties to "
        "women software developers who compete for, or otherwise threaten to advance to, high-status, masculine-coded "
        "positions. This is experienced when women in such positions who are agentic are perceived as extreme in "
