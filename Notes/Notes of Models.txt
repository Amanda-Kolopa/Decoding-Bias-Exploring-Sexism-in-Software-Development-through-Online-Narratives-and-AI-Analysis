Notes of Models to Compare/Implement

Aspects to consider:
	- Can we trace and analyze how the model produced the output?
	- We need to consider a similar metric (Elbow, Silhouette, etc.)



- TFIDF+Kmeans+LDA without keywords guidance (just applied to text) 
	- Traditional approach used in several papers
	- [DONE in A3]

- TFIDF+Kmeans+LDA with keywords guidance (use vectorized keywords to help relationship)
	- Traditional approach used in several papers
	- [DONE in A5]

- TFIDF+Kmeans+CMT without keywords guidance (just applied to text)
	- Traditional approach used in several papers
	- CMT is an extension of LDA (could compare potential improvements)

- TFIDF+Bottom-Up Hierarchical Clustering+LDA without keywords guidance (just applied to text) [DONE]
	- Traditional approach used in several papers
	-

- IDF-Smooth+Kmeans+LDA with keyword guidance (use vectorized keywords to help relationship)
	- Would need to see if this is possible (maybe it's novel)
	- IDF-Smooth helps when the keyword is not in corpus
