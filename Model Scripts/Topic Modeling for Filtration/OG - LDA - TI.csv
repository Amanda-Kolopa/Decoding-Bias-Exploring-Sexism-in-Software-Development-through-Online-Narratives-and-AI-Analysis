And then you keep compounding the error.

> When I went to the meeting room, there was a younger woman in the room probably in her mid to late 20s. None of the electrical engineers I have met before at my company have been women and in general the few women engineers we have all work on things like web and front end interface development.

Making wide generalizations 

>Since my manager had not corrected me when I said he/him, I assumed this person was some kind of product manager on their team or something. Did your manager know? Why are you making assumptions?

> She was also very dressed up, in a skirt, heels and makeup which is an attire product managers and HR people typically have.

So you decided she wasn't the engineer because she was dressed up?

> I also would have expected someone in this position to be much older.

Why?

> So, I told her, Ill be right back and make coffee while we wait for the engineer to arrive and to message me on slack if he arrives.

So you show up at a meeting that's been set up for you to meet the other engineer, see a young woman who is dressed up, assume it can't be her and then tell her to message you if the engineer arrives.

At no point did it occur to you to introduce yourself?

> AITA here? I feel embarrassed

This at least is a step in the right direction.

But what it really boils down to: if you have even basic decency, you would have entered the room, seen that there was a person there, introduced yourself - they would have introduced themselves too. 

And if you thought it was someone other than the engineer, they would have then introduced themselves and why they ALSO are in the meeting. It would have avoided this embarrassing mistake that has now gone to HR. 

But you made it so much worse by not even acknowledging that a person of any worth was there in the meeting room, in a professional capacity - even IF they were part of the meeting in a role you deem less important than your own. I mean what kind of a jackass doesn’t even ask?

I have gone into countless meetings where there are additional people who I don’t know are attending. It always starts as hi, I am so and so, with this and this role. They then introduce themselves and tell their role.

I'm a female machinist I've had shit like this happen and it sucks. I was training at a new shop and my mentor, let's call him ""Mike"", was out on vacation so I was running both machines. Even though it doesn't look like it I have been machining for 10 years (I'm 25, I went to trade school).


 I was waiting on a part that had been sent out for QC. I happened to walk by as they were unloading the part from the truck so I told the guy I could take it since I'd been waiting for that one. The guy was like ohh no this is for Mike. Which is understandable since I was new and he was from our other location so I'm sure he had no idea who I was, how could he? So I explained that Mike was out for the week so I could take it instead. And he was like no, no this is for the lathe department not deburring. It's rude to assume people's jobs based on how they look.


Multiple times I've had people come over to my area (which is kind of enclosed with two machines so it's not like people just hang out there) looking to deliver paperwork or tools for our area to ""Mike"" and when I tell them he's out they start to walk off and I'm like wait, no, I need those inserts to do my job.


I even had a maintenence guy come in to fix one of my machines and the dude didn't even LOOK at me. My boss (who lowkey sucks) brought him over and started explaining the issue. The boss doesn't run my machines. He works on the mills and definitely knows a lot about machines, but I'm the one that had been working on that one every day. I just kept quiet and worked on my other machine while he was like 5 feet away trying to fix the machine. He ended up not even fixing the issue. He thought he did and left in less than an hour. Maybe if he had asked me he would have figured it out but instead the company wasted hundreds of dollars because he didn't even bother to consult the machinist to see if the machine was working properly after.

I think the point here is whether or not you thought the person was the engineer you rudely left to make coffee without first introducing yourself to the person in the room. Also, if you truly had already met her by the time you got back you would have learned her name and knew immediately that she was the engineer. In a professional environment meeting someone means introducing yourself to them and learning their name and role etc.

This should be a wake up call for your professional interactions and I hope you can listen to what she and HR have to say. As someone who works as an HR consultant I highly recommend you not use the the qualifiers you used in this post to excuse your behavior. Any reference to a woman’s attire or appearance is absolutely inappropriate and blaming your manager or others who did not correct you on pronouns will be seen as not taking responsibility. 

On this note, it could be that your colleagues and manager are used to your assumptions of gender based on job titles and have looked the other way as to not make waves since it is clear you are very set in your opinions and not welcome to the idea of a changing workplace where those who are younger or female are your peers. This sounds like a perfect time to own your behavior, reflect on your past judgements, and begin to understand your biases so that you can begin the work of changing them. 

In the future I would recommend broadening your perspective in terms of how women appear to you by thinking about how harmful categorization can be. In this instance it has been directly harmful for you. Women face this categorization and discrimination every single day in the professional workplace and although I am sure you do not see yourself as someone who perpetuates this, you are clearly a direct participant in such behavior. Sadly there are no excuses for it no matter how much you may have really needed that coffee, but you can turn this into something positive by being honest with yourself.

I (42M) work at a tech company that works in a very specialized domain. I am a software engineer but work with some very custom hardware chips in my day to day. 

My team needed to integrate a new micro controller into a product we are designing and since I am the lead for the software that will interact with this component my manager set up a meeting for me with the electrical engineer in charge of designing that component who is on a different team.

I have worked with various such other teams in the past but this component was one that is considered quite specialized. When my manager and I talked about it, he did not refer much to the engineer I would be meeting and refereed to the team and used the they/them pronoun. I refereed to the designer as he many times and my manager did not correct me. The name was also very gender neutral.

When I went to the meeting room, there was a younger woman in the room probably in her mid to late 20s. None of the electrical engineers I have met before at my company have been women and in general the few women engineers we have all work on things like web and front end interface development. Since my manager had not corrected me when I said he/him, I assumed this person was some kind of product manager on their team or something. She was also very dressed up, in a skirt, heels and makeup which is an attire product managers and HR people typically have. I also would have expected someone in this position to be much older.

So, I told her, Ill be right back and make coffee while we wait for the engineer to arrive and to message me on slack if he arrives. When I got back, I said something like ""he hasn't arrived yet"".

She then finally mentioned she was the engineer and angrily stormed out. I sent an apology email to her but she has not responded yet but an HR representative has added a meeting to my work calendar and I can see that she has a meeting at the same time on hers.

AITA here? I feel embarrassed and I did not mean to assume she was not the engineer, had my manager told me, or had she had a feminine name or profile picture I would have not done so. I looked up her profile and she really is the most qualified person to work with me on this even though she is really young.

What you're ultimately saying is ""we aren't mature enough to treat you like a colleague""

She's pretty, so what? What's that got anything to do with her ability to work.

You've been asked to mentor someone who is *completely* alone at work. There are no other women or minorities at your company (which is pretty bad in itself btw). So she has no one to relate to, AND has to try to ingratiate herself with a bunch of cavedwellers who are incapable of just treating this poor woman normally.

And you, someone supposed to be mentoring her, *entirely* dropped the ball. You are doing a bad job.

>I explained that they’re a little intimidated and surprised but that it’s nothing to worry about. She was confused and I explained that her appearance and demeanour aren’t something the guys are used to. She asked me what that meant and I said that she looks great and carries herself in an elegant, respectable way. 

>After our conversation she seemed even more withdrawn and uncomfortable

Then his boss explains that he'll have to be patient with the situation because all of the women have a traumatic past and don't know how to interact with ""Abercrombie studs"" like him.

•	More subtle forms of harassment include commenting on the attractiveness of others in front of an employee

-	To qualify as a hostile work environment, the conduct must be offensive not only to the employee, but also to a reasonable person in the same circumstances.

However, the average person probably wouldn't consider that conduct alone to rise to the level of harassment.

That's because it's the woke crowds job to be offended at everything they can be offended at. They work at that. And so everything that is offensive or can be offensive, can be found online, on an opinion piece somewhere.

However, on the flip side it's not a persons job to tell what things they're okay with.

>Look at the down votes you've gotten claiming this multiple times. Step back and learn.

Downvotes are not a sign of being wrong. People get downvoted when they're not immediately in intense agreement with public opinion.

Also, downvotes are dependent on the kind of crowd which is circling the post at any given moment.

There are many many instances of people who have wrong opinions aggregating on posts, and presenting their opinion as the default.

All of this means that the correctness of a comment is largely independent of the upvotes or downvotes it recieves. People are poor judges here on reddit.

>Exactly so when multiple articles and people and resources tell you something.
>Proof?

Where is your proof? Citing an opinion piece is not proof that it's a universal law.

There are ""multiple articles"" and ""resources"" telling people the earth is flat.

>Observed by whom? Cause everything I'm finding by POC says not to use it

Observed by me, in my experience.

No, one thing you're finding is the opposite of your claim. I'm okay with the word exotic.

I worked in tech. SO many men fall into exactly the category you described. They are profoundly nervous to be around an attractive woman. So many people here are shocked and appalled by this fact, but it is indeed the case. Has no one here had a highschool or younger crush and were paralyzed by nervousness around them? Many of these guys have simply not developed emotionally past that state and largely surround themselves with others just like that. Being in close proximity to a very attractive woman is, in fact, rare in those circles. 

You go from work...to home... to play online games...to back to work. Is extreme intorversion something they are to be blamed for? Do you chastise someone for being nervous around a crush? You cannot force confidence into someone. They are reacting genuinely and from a place of adoration. I think many are failing to empathize with the emotional immaturity plight of the average tech nerd.

 She asked why they were reacting that way. You literally told her exactly the truth. They are immature guys that are nervous around attractive women. So you handed her an unintended compliment as well as told her the truth. How dare you? In fact, if she isn't told the truth now she will go through her career never knowing what the hell is wrong with people. In fact, it's sexist to lie to her about this to ""protect her"" and her apparently fragile self esteem.

>Men can’t talk to women unless women will talk to them.

I said nothing to dispute that; in fact, I specifically stated that no one should be ostracized simply for suffering from social anxiety and the like.

So, yes. That much is true. But how exactly do you know that women *won't* talk to them...? OP's coworkers seemed to do a perfectly fine job at that, until they met ""the new girl"" in-person.

Women *will* talk to these men. It's not as if they have some target on their back that identifies them as ""this man is someone who women shouldn't talk to.""

&#x200B;

Also, this:

>Presumably these men are unattractive

is a total assumption on your part. I am a woman who works in the IT industry as a software engineer myself; I have met many men with poor social skills & similar struggles who were fairly attractive.

To jump from ""they struggle to communicate with women"" to the conclusion of ""they must be unattractive & totally helpless"" is pure stereotype. Being unattractive is a requirement for neither having social anxiety, nor working in the tech industry.

&#x200B;

But more importantly, you previously said:

>I think it’s just a matter of waiting, blaming them for not having learned how to do something they’ve never done before, by no fault of their own.

It may not be their fault, but that doesn't mean they are free to cast blame upon others who had nothing to do with it.

To quote Denice Frohman: ""Your wound is probably not your fault, but your healing is your responsibility.""

&#x200B;

>A woman has to make the effort to break that cycle

The effort is their own responsibility. It does not belong to women.

So, if they want to get better at talking to women... they need to *take the initiative to get out there and talk to women.*

You are so focused on your *reasons* for behaving this way that you can’t understand that your *reasons* don’t matter. No matter what was going through all of your heads, the impact remains the same. 

Instead of thinking about yourself, try to put yourself in her shoes for one second. Starting a new job can be incredibly intimidating. Add onto that the fact that women of color are so underrepresented in tech. So in addition to new-job jitters, she also has to worry about the very high likelihood that she will face misogyny and racism from her new coworkers. Just as her fears were easing, you confirmed them by showing that you all can’t see her as a qualified professional and equal member of the team, because first and foremost you see her as an *exotic woman,* which is so fucking dehumanizing. So once again, she’s been singled out because of her gender and race. She joined your company for the *same* professional reasons that you and all your other “pasty nerd” coworkers did, but you see her as different. You don’t find it necessary to make sure she’s treated with the same respect and professional regard as everyone else. And you don’t feel guilty that you made her feel othered, as though she as a woman of color were some *exotic* spectacle on display for a bunch of white men. And you think that’s a *compliment* rather than incredibly objectifying. 

Do some Google searches with some combinations of “exotic” + microaggressions + racism + misogyny + women of color + tech, etc… You will instantly find hundreds of articles that exist for the express purpose of educating people just like you. All your comments are identical to those that have been said millions of times before. You are not saying anything new, and you are part of a very real ongoing problem. You can choose to educate yourself and be better. You’re not a woman of color, so how would you know anything about what it’s like to be one unless you make an effort to find out?

I'm 5'9, blonde hair blue eyes with an excessively large chest (I've been told they are a 'gift'  from God by my grandma, and a 'curse' by my chiropractor, but only saying this to explain they are real and not a chioce). I also happen to be the head of HR for the entire Americas Region for a company comprised of mostly a bunch of male engineers.  I get respect.  They are nerds. They joke with me.  They invite me out to lunch with the group even though I know for a fact my looks are intimidating to at least a couple of them (we can totally tell by the way).   

So after spending 6 years in hr in tech specifically(15 overall), I will acknowledge, nerds sometimes lack in social skills, but at no point should that be anyone else's problem except for their own.  You basically told her, ""well what did you expect walking in here looking all sexy and exotic, next time if you want to be accepted try not showering for a week and wear stained t-shirts once in a while, geez, they're only human!"" FYI - I know women who do this, but the problem with this approach is when it comes to promotions, no one wants to promote the slob who doesn't shower.  You try walking that fine line, the goal is to look nice but not nice enough to be fuckable, and if you slip off that very fine line you get labeled as ""slutty"" or trying to sleep her way to the top.  I know, I've been accused of both and both accusations are false but that one time I showed cleavage at a formal event sooooo... 

Here's how the conversation should have went.  ""You are concerned no one's talking to you,  I wouldn't take it personally, these guys have been stuck in basements for the past 2 years and forgot how to talk in real life, and to be honest they weren't that polished before.  The legit forgot what it's like to meet new people in person, give them a day or two to adjust to natural light and I'm sure they'll sort themselves out.  Nerds, am I right, excuse me, I'll be right back""....

Discreetly take the team members aside who are acting like 12 year old boys and remind them they are in a professional work environment and not a junior high dance,  they they have are expected to treat her as a member of the team AND remind if they can't be on a team with an attractive female, it will be them leaving the team not her.  

Besides,  again from an HR perspective, you may want to check labor laws in your area. There are special restrictions to employing minors. I fully get that there are 12 year old boys who are my tech savvy than I'll ever be, but that doesn't mean you can hire them to work in your IT department.  You might be okay if the guys on the team are between 16 - 18, but you'll need to check your state laws, usually they have working hour restrictions....  unless I misunderstood and these are actually grown men, in which case... wtf really?

""Why is everyone acting so weird around me?"" asks the new team member.

Now,  that's the truth,  right?
But,  saying the actual truth is ... inappropriate, at least to the majority of Reddit's readers. To speak this truth is the height of both bluntnesss and a lack of human class. 

All those condemning the OP as an A-hole are not wrong,  but certainly not right. The entire team has issues with their ability to self-control around a new team member who triggers their instinct to sexual attraction. Yes,  it's easy enough for Reddit's woke mob to demand that these guys BE BETTER, but the fact is : THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTROL THEIR BEHAVIOR WHEN THEY ARE SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO A TEAMMATE. Don't be confused. because this not an excuse. Would you be angry at a child who can't stop biting their nails or making clicking sounds in their throat? Adult men who've not been properly taught how to control their emotions on this issue are to be pitied, and gently educated about how to become more mature.  The more they are angrily condemned and shamed, the more difficult it becomes for them to effect positive change in their personal development. 
The OP is in a difficult situation because he appears to know this is poor behavior, and the new coworker specifically asked what the problem was,  as she sensed something was strange. He thought telling her the truth was the best decision. 
 
If you feel telling the truth should be punished because it made the new coworker uncomfortable,  -and that this constituted sexual harassment, according to some other Redditors in this thread- you are entitled to that opinion of course. I simply disagree. Yes, the OP perhaps lacked judgement in their decision to speak the unpleasant truth; but this makes only them unwise. 

Being an asshole , at least in my opinion,  requires intention, and not just ignorance.

The larger issue I want you to consider  is just simply that of the reality we all share.  

Not everyone shares your values and sense of what is correct behavior. How men Should and Could treat women has been an issue since the beginning of the human species. How much sexual attraction can and does disturb the focus of many men has been a known issue since forever. It certainly is a problem, and different cultures have vastly different traditions and expectations on the subject.  

These issues won't change for the better until a clear acceptance of what the problem is (lack of emotional self control) and how to address it and improve upon it becomes a shared understanding across first a nation, and then,  hopefully in some distant future,  across the world. 

This issue was the true metaphorical teaching at the heart of the Western Christian tradition of the Garden of Eden. The sex organs ARE the  metaphorical fruit of the tree of good and evil.  They can give great pleasure and contentment  when used and controlled responsibly, or they can be a source of great evil when used selfishly or with violence. Upon this correct understanding, the future of the human species has always turned. The more a culture practices love and mutual respect between All men and women (and those in the non-binary middle zones between them), the more  successful and happy they will be.  The less? A culture riddled with misogyny,  sexual trauma and guilt,  and unintended children, many without loving parents, who carry on the legacy until they become wise enough to break it.

And don’t give me that whole “you’ve never been awkward before in front of someone u find attractive?” Why? Well I’m glad u fucking asked.

(1) Just to confirm. When you find someone attractive, you tend to say racist things? 

How is that being awkward. That is a level far beyond awkward. Veryyy specific choice of terminology you use have to use there. Must be in your typical vocabulary otherwise why would you default to saying it when ur “awkward” because ur “oh so terribly overcome by a woman’s looks”. 

Odd. most men don’t seem to actually default to that. 

(2) also just to confirm, you sexually harass women when you find them attractive too?

So again. Your default awkward state is to be sexist and to sexually harass women. Glad to know that’s also so normal for you that you default to it when in an “awkward” situation . 

Huh. Somehow again most men don’t actually do that. 

(3) Presumably you’ve worked with women before, or even *gasp* talked to them, as that’s basically half of the entire world’s population. 

So. You are completely incapable of treating them like a person (aka with any semblance of respect) purely because you find them attractive? You are COMPLETELY incapable of talking to them? Or collaborating together? And you are completely incapable of overcoming your inability to do this? So much so that you literally run away when they are close? Even though it is your JOB to work with them? 

I mean wow how genuinely childish! Attractive woman in ur vicinity —> ahh you blundered bc ur so “entranced by her looks” (eugh I want to throw up after saying that) —> oh no Can’t work with them because of how they look! —> run away and give the silent treatment suddenly and make zero attempt. Like come on mate, literally almost every kid I know is better than that. 

Hmm how odd again! Seems like pretty much everyone else here was able to. 

But yes of course poor men. how sad it is that you can’t control your impulses. How sad it is how hysterical you get. I feel bad for you and your “men”. 

(4) Ah sorry (not really), to confirm again: you think with your dick to the almost-unbelievable point where the ONLY thing you can point out about a woman who is attractive to you is that they are…attractive? 

Nothing deeper there? You cannot think about someone you like further than that? Wow. 


(5) ah okay so your Average man acts like a racist, a sexist and runs away with their tail between their legs when they encounter someone attractive? Huh. Interesting choice group of people you interact and surround yourself with. 

(6) last one because I cannot be arsed to waste another second on you. You are SOOOOO dense and lack so much reading comprehension that the only thing you’ve taken away by everyone else’s comments is that…people act awkwardly? Even though they’ve explained in pain-staking detail and simple terminology EXACTLY why OP and u are wrong and it is far more than mere “awkwardness”? are their words too big for u? 

I mean between your cowardice, sexism, racism, and all around density and stupidity, you Really must not have anyyy women interested in u (other than ur mum if she’s still in ur life or unless u somehow find her attractive too). Youd have to hole up alone or somehow only among other men who are just as daft and shitty as you, and work together to avoid all women at all costs!! Because women are, according to you, so scary!! You can’t even hold an intelligent conversation with them!! Pathetic really.

This is completely unlike the unlimited channels of information and bandwidth that actual wire/fiber brings. Each can operate independently of all the others and be faster than all the wireless spectrum in use combined.

That's the primary reason that wireless telcos have such small data transfer limits. And it's why no wireless telco solution should ever be considered broadband.

The Second Bill of Rights is a list of rights that was proposed by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt during his State of the Union Address on Tuesday, January 11, 1944. In his address, Roosevelt suggested that the nation had come to recognize and should now implement, a second ""bill of rights."" Roosevelt's argument was that the ""political rights"" guaranteed by the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights had ""proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness."" His remedy was to declare an ""economic bill of rights"" to guarantee these specific rights:

Employment, Food, clothing, and leisure with enough income to support them

Farmers' rights to a fair income

Freedom from unfair competition and monopolies

Housing

Medical care

Social security

Education

Roosevelt stated that having such rights would guarantee American security, and that the US's place in the world depended upon how far the rights had been carried into practice.

by saying that it was 100% Republicans fault this happened, and saying the Dems were 100% behind this not happening. This is untrue. This is dishonest, and hurts the cause.

Some internet is better than no internet. But this isn't the issue in this context. That's like saying ""some paycheck is better than no paycheck"" when your employer shorts you.

The problem here is not that people will not have internet. The problem is that ISP's were paid tax dollars to the tune of $400 billion, and never built the ""broadband"" networks they were obligated to. Even more frustrating, is that the legal definition of broadband at the time of the agreement was 45mbps in both directions.

Now obviously these companies weren't given 400 billion up front. They took their payment in the form of deregulation, and were allowed to keep what the government had previously taken as taxes.

This is why most people are not in favour of the deregulation of the  internet. It has happened before and has proven itself to be largely harmful to the consumer and small ISP's (google itself had an extremely hard time installing fiber due to the monopolies), while pre-existing super-corporations in the form of ISP's roll in profits.

While I tend to stay away from sourcing blog sections of publications, [this article](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/the-book-of-broken-promis_b_5839394.html) is a very accurate description of what happened through the 90's and 2000's  to lead the internet to where it is now, and provides a great view as to why people would be upset with the FCC.

Repealing net neutrality would work in an actual free market...but network infrastructure isn’t currently a free market. 

See, there’s this fundamental aspect of capitalism called COMPETITION. Do you know what Competition is? When there isn’t any competition it breaks capitalism; stagnants innovation, lower employment, creates monopolies. 

Competition helps innovation and is great for the consumer because businesses compete to try and provide the best service at the lowest price. It gives the consumer choice. You know choice, right? That whole freedom thing...

You see, there is no competition in the current market because ISPs have created duopolies and legal monopolies in areas to where something like 80% of Americans have 2 or less choices of ISP. 

Net neutrality makes it so these ISP can’t nickel and dime us like you seem to want. They have to provide a service and can’t REGULATE that service for more profit (exspecially since the government installed the infrastructure in the first place). If there was an actual choice and free market we wouldn’t need net neutrality. 

But You’re okay with it cause Trump, who’s done nothing but real estate his whole life, said net neutrality is bad and cause....OBAMA!

The willful ignorance is too much. 


Maybe look up why google fiber is having such a hard time. Maybe look at all the trouble local municipalities have had trying to start an public ISP.

We allow very wealthy people and industries, the 1%, to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence politics. Our media is owned by extremely wealthy interests so news media pretty much sticks to the point of view of the wealthy. For almost 40 years, Americans have been told that collective action doesn't work so either change things all by yourself or give up. Unions, strikes, national strikes, protests, political action, etc, all useless. In other words, learned helplessness. It is now at the point that we won't even try. For example, Americans now have well over $1 *trillion* in student loan debt which many will never be able to pay off their entire working lives and laws have been passed preventing people from getting rid of it in bankruptcy. Lenders can even divert someone's social security retirement benefits to pay the debt even if that means the person becomes homeless and hungry. You would think with over $1 *trillion* in debt, people struggling to pay it would collectively use it as leverage to get Congress to lower the interest, reinstate the bankruptcy laws, etc. But nope, every one of those people believes there's nothing they can do.

I predict that when things become truly impossible, then and only then will Americans collectively stand up for themselves. So far, every time things get worse, nothing happens. You would think lack of affordable healthcare alone would get people in the streets, or lack of net neutrality, or student loan debt, or lack of social safety nets. So far, nothing.

I said:

>I think the more nuanced argument isn't ""both parties are the same"", but something more akin, ""both parties are in pockets of corporations"" or party to screwing consumers. Or at least, that's the version you'd be more likely to see online. Within the context of these specific kinds of debates at least, in can require some parsing.

In reply to a person talking more generally about running across arguments about ""both parties are the same"" online (or not running across them as the case may be), *they* said (for reference, again):

>>I don't think I made my point very clearly. The only time I hear a variation of that phrase is when it said as the person above me did: good luck getting past the ""both parties are the same"" echo chamber. It is said sarcastically, targeted at an unknown group of people, which I have never personally witnessed. This sarcastic attack on the phrase is the meme I was referring to. It's a meme within a meme. Memeception.

In my comment, I was attempting to reflect a sentiment you might *actually* see more often, which is the feeling that both parties may have screwed you over at some point.  I used the specific example of surveillance (as revealed by Snowden, et al.), because that surveillance garnered support of not just Republicans, but Obama/Pelosi/et al (other notable Dems like Wyden protested against it).

And indeed, your own copy-pasta supports this point, because many democrats *have* supported these things, from you:

> **FISA Act Reauthorization of 2008**

> **FISA Reauthorization of 2012** 

I also explicitly stated:
> **That doesn't make the parties the same of course** , which makes sense, since my point was to talk about the *kind* of arguments people make, not my own position.

I ended my comment suggesting people need to be active in primaries to ensure their candidates carry the values they care about (re: if you make surveillance/net-neutrality a point in the primaries, you can either get a ""better"" candidate or force a leader to adopt it into their platform).

>2007 – AT&T censored Pearl Jam because lead singer criticized President Bush.

>2007 to 2009 – AT&T forced Apple to block Skype because it didn’t like the competition. At the time, the carrier had exclusive rights to sell the iPhone and even then the net neutrality advocates were pushing the government to protect online consumers, over 5 years before these rules were actually passed.

>2009 – Google Voice app faced similar issues from ISPs, including AT&T on iPhone.

>2010 – Windstream Communications, a DSL provider, started hijacking search results made using Google toolbar. It consistently redirected users to Windstream’s own search engine and results.

>2011 – MetroPCS, one of the top-five wireless carriers at the time, announced plans to block streaming services over its 4G network from everyone except YouTube.

>2011 to 2013 – AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon blocked Google Wallet in favor of Isis, a mobile payment system in which all three had shares. Verizon even asked Google to not include its payment app in its Nexus devices.

>2012 – AT&T blocked FaceTime; again because the company didn’t like the competition.

>2012 – Verizon started blocking people from using tethering apps on their phones that enabled consumers to avoid the company’s $20 tethering fee.

I do still believe 100mbps would be a great baseline though. The average consumer today does not do that, but in 2-3 years, who knows. There is also the need for work purposes. More and more people are working from home, some are photographers/videographers/graphic designers/etc.

There was a time when files were measured in MB (I'm fully aware that bytes do not changes over time, I'm stating that average file size was not large) and you could not work remotely, but that has changed and I think we should keep that in mind when setting minimums in this industry.  Also, while we were still counting by the MB we were paying a ton as taxpayers for a new fiber network which should have been installed and lit up by the time we started counting by the GB. Today, where files are measured by the several GB, we are still being charged fees monthly for that buildout that never happened in any meaningful way.

Network equipment lasts quite a while, as do the fiber/copper lines that connect them together. While I was in Telecom, I was working on sometimes a decade old chassis with newer cards that could support newer SFP modules and would see 1G+ trunks regularly. I want to say 10G was the norm. That was at my small Telecom, not a massive ISP and a budget to reflect that. While an initial buildout is stupid expensive, if you get 10+ years out of the big gear and charge an arbitrary $1/Mbps (I'd pay $300+/m instead of $120/m, yikes!) per customer you'd still make a pretty penny after paying your folks/upstream providers/rent/utilities/stuff that breaks/labor for the broken stuff. Remember, the ISP can handle a shit-ton of customers at once, they just don't want to. It is in their best interest to keep speeds low (not upgrading) and prices high (gotta line those pockets). I'm down for letting them make money, but this is just abuse at this point. That last bit I am surely just preaching to the choir :) .

Second link is an absolute joke of an article more transfixed on tagging Keynesian rhetoric to Obama while not listing one direct quote of Obama attaching anything to Bush. He actually mentioned Europe. Have you even attempted to read these lightly googled links?

Third one. An opinion piece from the National Review, are you fucking serious. And it is republicans, not Bush. Again, no direct mention of Bush and instead the Republican Politicians whose stances he disagrees with. Who, by the way, vowed to do absolutely nothing to come to any workable solutions. They were out to cripple him from day one. 

Again, they say he blames Bush, but there is absolutely no proof, no reference, no quote...merely an opinion in a right wing rag where they said it, so it must be true.

Lets try number four. USNews, ok, but wait, its an opinion piece...does it have any facts? Sure...lets see them: ""If the price of certainty is essentially for us to adopt the exact same proposals that were in place for eight years leading up to the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression ... the result is going to be the same. I don't know why we would expect a different outcome pursuing the exact same policy that got us into this fix in the first place."" Last week, **Obama also issued a blame-Bush statement with his budget request**: ""On the day my administration took office,"" he said, ""we faced an additional $7.5 trillion in national debt by the end of this decade as a result of the failure to pay for two large tax cuts, primarily for the wealthiest Americans, and a new entitlement program. We also inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression—which, even before we took any action, added an additional $3 trillion to the national debt.""

But what we see in the USNews piece are actually facts that the writer attributes to Bush bashing, when in reality Bush was never even mentioned, instead the economic reality that existed at the time was. 

None of these even remotely come close to showing the type of blame the current administration has cast on the previous. As I stated, the economics and war would be it, and those are real in their existence. Obama was not manufacturing systematic blaming of Bush, intellectual differences and existential realities, yes, outright lies, obfuscation, no. 

I am an independent and associate with neither party. That said, only a complete dolt would argue that the current administration and the previous are speaking in the same level and with the same tone of the one before them. There has been nothing even close to the shit show being performed right now and the endless blaming and finger pointing and flat out lies, constant lies.

Exactly, but it's more than that: They were hated for the *way* they opposed the Obama administration. Deferring the SCOTUS pick was one of the most obvious ones, but government shutdowns, refusing to appoint cabinet positions and judges, the ""Saudi 9/11 law"" fiasco, stating on day 1 that their goal was to oppose the president at every turn, etc. were all tricks that were used to dump shit on Obama. While the Dems did do some of these things in the past (like blocking the naming of Robert Bork to SCOTUS), it was nothing like what the GOP did.

>Even though they have complete power in all branches of government, they still think of themselves as the opposition so they just keep doing things to spite the Democrats.

They still think of Democrats as their enemy. Not just their enemy, actually -- *America's* enemy. It's not enough just to beat them -- the GOP needs to *destroy* them and everything they stand for because they have painted them as anti-American. Nobody in the DNC has said or done anything of that scale to antagonize or decimate the Republicans like the Republicans want to do to the DNC.

>It's sad that they're using their power to take revenge on the Democrats rather than having a conservative solution to the nation's problems.

This will be the Democrats' saving grace if they don't fuck it up. Instead of being ""Trump bad, Dems good"" they need to get better at saying *why* they're better than the GOP. They can even compare their plans to the Republicans' plans using neutral language because of how ghoulish some of these proposals are on paper. Most importantly, they need to talk up economic issues and downplay *but not change or sell their souls* on social issues. Tell Farmer Joe how you'll protect his farm from Trump's environmental rollbacks and how these protections will enable them to keep the business in the family for generations. That sorta thing. Obama was good at doing this, while Hillary sucked.

>The closeness between corporate America and the political establishment is also troubling. I'm not going to say that Democrats are innocent but it seems that Republicans are more likely to bend to corporate demands in return for campaign contributions and kickbacks.

The problem of money in politics isn't new, but a few key SCOTUS rulings (*Citizens United* and the ""money = speech"" case in particular) added fuel to the fire. Now, at least for the time being, you need money and corporate backing to make it. This is where the Dems will fail because they'll want a candidate untouched by Big Money and won't be willing to compromise and support someone who believes 95% of the same things they do. The GOP learned this a generation ago thanks to Reagan's Eleventh Commandment and look how much power they have now.

Those were the utopists, inspired by Thomas Moor's *Utopia*, and they were widely criticized for their lack of a plan. The most modern approach would be Communalism, a philosophy and strategy developed by Murray Bookchin. These ideas are the ideological underpinning of the current revolution in Rojava (the Kurdish area of Syria). He advocated a dual power strategy, essentially creating a egalitarian structure in parallel with the state which would eventually replace it via the state giving up power willingingly or an inevitable revolution if it didn't.

As far as the history of practical theory is concerned, one of the first was David Ricardo, who in the 1820's and 30's advocated for a free market of worker owned cooperatives and built heavily off of Adam Smith's work. Robert Owen had similar ideas at around the same time. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon expanded on the idea and added community credit unions to start new worker owned cooperatives to the model. He advocated a tax on capitalist enterprises to fund the creation of cooperatives and gradually replace traditional structures with workplace democracy.  Proudhon was the first person to start using the term ""anarchism"" to describe his beliefs, literally meaning ""no rulers"" (a lack of hierarchy, not organization). However, later theorists have largely rejected reformism. Reform may be able to win some concessions, but that always revolves compromise and replacing a feudal structure with a democratic is not a gradient but a discrete set of choices making victory via reform next to impossible. 

The next development was anarcho-collectivisim (developed by Mikhail Bakunin), replacing the market with a system of labor vouchers, and anarcho-communism (developed by [Peter Kropotkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jytf-5St8WU)), using a gift economy. Anarcho-syndicalism developed as a strategy of implementing these systems. The plan was to create a big trade union to organize a general strike in which the capitalist businesses would be seized to be run democratically by the workers. The union would form a loose network to organize these independent democratic workplaces. This strategy met with a great deal of success in the Spanish Civil War, although the Soviets only giving weapons to the Stalinist factions and the eventual loss of the war led to a premature end before the system could face the test of time on its own merits. However, this strategy is most impactful if labor is in demand, and the problem we're facing is the elimination of human labor. It was also developed when people commonly worked 12-14 hour days and workers for the same jobs often shared the same communities. I should note that these revolutionary unions were more decentralized than the more mainstream business unions that work alongside capitalism. Communalism broadens the approach to more facets of our lives.

There's also libertarian Marxist philosophies like council communism and Marxist-DeLeonism which rejected Lenin's centralization. De Leonism was a largely American strategy of basically doing the same thing as anarcho-syndicalism but by using the state to immediately transfer power to the decentralized unions (primarily the IWW) rather than taking control directly. However, in the US, the IWW and other such organizations were successfully crushed by the state's militias and the FBI (whose founding purpose was to repress these ideas).

I was introduced to Rand by my godfather when I was around 12, and I’ve read everything she ever published including the transcripts of her speeches.  For a while there I really admired her, but then - as I entered my late teenaged years - I began to realize that not only were her ideas intellectually bankrupt, but she was also a shit writer.  I pointed this out to my godfather, who had given me well over a hundred books as I was growing up, all of them great *except for the Rand*... he said “I wanted you to get it out of your system early.”  I tell you what, that man is a saint.  He really shaped my life, just as a godfather should.

The works of hers that I read after this point were consumed so that I could argue the points of her ideology (and “philosophy,” which is a terribly generous description of Objectivism) with those who were yet to awaken from their Randian slumber.  Frankly, it’s all the most basic bullshit:  Her books have one-dimensional self-insert vanity characters, where a “good guy” will have a strong jawline, cold, clear, flashing steel-colored eyes, and a name like “Frank Awesomesauce.”  “Bad guys” will have a flabby paunch, watery red eyes, a bulbous nose and a name like “Mooch McCommie.”  

Female characters are either fat nags who believe that the strong, beautiful men they’ve somehow become married to owe them everything in exchange for nothing but abuse, or they’re gorgeous, intelligent, and strong except when they’re being brutally fucked by a much stronger man with a lot of money. 

The things the “good guys” build in the books rely on magic to actually work.  There are also often “regular” people - take “Eddie Willers” for example.  He’s an average guy - not a sexy genius like “Ragnar Danneskjold” or “Hank Rearden” (you can tell because his name makes him sound like a weak pussy) - but he works hard, he dedicates his life to making sure that the train company he works for operates the way it’s supposed to in order to make the Taggarts all of their very well-deserved (because they *own* the railroad and this makes them *better*, you see) money.

Where does he end up at the close of *Atlas Shrugged*?  Sitting in the desert with a broken train while Dagny and the rest of the gods have fucked off to a magical valley in Colorado.  He’s probably gonna die out there, and why?  He did his job, he wasn’t a commie, he kept true faith to his betters, but... well, he’s just not rich and sexy, so he should probably sit down on the tracks and die.  This is basically Rand’s message to humanity - and it’s a shame that so many *obvious* Eddie Willers read her stuff, convince themselves they’re John Galt, and buy into it.  News flash normies:  If you’re not a billionaire inventor by the age of 25, *you are Eddie Willers* and the philosophy you’re subscribing to wants you used up to fund the ravishing of an heiress by your boss.

Rand never ran a business, but she *did* wind up on welfare.

She was a dumb hypocrite, a bad writer, and her ideas are like memetic cancer.

Rand is only really good for determining whether or not a person is a waste of one’s time:  If they’re in their mid-20s and they don’t think she’s total horseshit, it’s best to stay *far* away.

Sorry for the rant.  I partially blame Rand’s statements and ideology for the depression and eventual suicide of a close friend... not to mention a lot of the *really* bad policies of our government over the years.  Ugh.  Really can’t stand her shit.  I feel like if I could have just argued my points better, maybe he’d have dropped his obsession with her and realized that the fact that his life trajectory wasn’t matching up with the Randian Ideal was *normal* and not an indication that he was a disgusting failure.  It certainly didn’t help that he was gay, either.  Damn.

1. Once you get past undergrad stage, things get tougher for women. For example, most people get married in grad school/during a postdoc. This means that people start having kids around that time as well. Postdocs, which are extremely short-term, are not really set up for someone to take maternity leave during. If you're grant funded for two years, it's extremely hard to be productive enough to get a faculty position because birthing a child and recovering from that is equivalent to having major surgery, and then you have to adjust to managing to keep a small helpless creature alive. Also, women are statistically more likely to be married to another scientist, which makes two-body problems a big area of concern.
2. Nope, not condescending to me.  Anecdotally (and I know there is also some actual evidence for this, I can find it later if you are interested), mediocre women drop out of science much earlier than mediocre men. So while mediocre women often don't even both to apply to grad school because they don't think they are good enough, mediocre men may stick around through grad school and even a postdoc.

1.  I am able to recognize the additional challenges that underrepresented minorities must overcome in order to succeed in STEM.  But, I find it more difficult to understand that challenges that women in STEM must overcome that their male counterparts do not.  Would any of you be willing share with me specific challenges that you have had to overcome in your careers?  I am specifically wondering about academia because I am in academia and have never worked in industry.

2.  In 2018, of the 2000 people that received NSF Graduate Research Fellowships, 1,156 (57.8%) were women
(https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=245024&org=NSF).  I do not know what percentage of applicants were male.  But, let's suppose that 43% of the 12,000 applications were women, which is consistent with the percentage of STEM PhDs that are female in the United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_STEM_fields#United_States).  Under this assumption, roughly 22.4% of female applications were successful compared to a roughly 12.4% success rate for male applications.  Two questions (i) does the almost 2/1 disparity in the success rate seem in any way condescending to you?  And (ii) do you think maintaining such an imbalance in the success rate of applicatns is important for broadening participation in women in STEM?

All else being equal, the 2/1 disparity seems ""unfair"" to males.  But, I understand that ""all else"" is not equal -- I just struggle to understand how. If you are willing to answer my first questions, I hope to gain a better understanding.

Then we got better at maintaining that charge over long times, and at reading out the exact charge. 0% charge = 00b, 25%=01b, 50%=10b and 100%=11b. Now we're at three bits per cell.

Digits , are base 10 numerals. they represent 10 possible digits, so if you have one digit you've got the ability to represent 10 values. 
if you have 2 digits you can have 10^2 values 0-99. 3 gives you 10 ^3 or 1000 values 0-999 etc etc etc 

Bits work the exact same way except they represent base 2 so 1 bit is 2 values 0-1, 2 bits is 2^2 or 4 values 0-3, 3 bits is 2^3 or 8 values 0-7 and so on. 

Now the reason that Bits are important is because they are easy to represent. On or of, presence or absence, electrically charged or not, positive or negative magnetic etc etc there are a bunch of very easy ways to represent yes or no, and repeating that gives you the ability to represent as many values as you please in a very simple and unambiguous way.

It's a rudimentary operation that happens all the time. Things also triple and quadruple of course but it's not as natural of an operation in arithmetic, since it's adding something to itself many times instead of just, you know, just doubling. The number 2 is like the ""e"" of discrete operations. It's much more significant than any other base number (which means 2 or above, since base 1 and 0 are a whole other story). There are many arithmetic problems that require a binary representation to make any sense, the same just isn't true with other bases.

For example, the problem of fast exponentiation modulo some number. Using a binary representation of n you can find the answer to any remainder problem in the form x^n congruent to a (mod b). Using any other representation of n doesn't allow for a quick decomposition of x^n, and therefore is useless computationally. That's just ONE direct use of binary for a fundamental concept within arithmetic, not just how we decided to design computers with electrical engineering constraints in mind.

You're probably used to dismantling arguments with the ol' chicken before the egg statement, but only because nobody actually knows number theory when they try to insist on the significance of binary over other bases. Any citation of how our current computing paradigm works is circular reasoning, of course. But powers of two were used to decompose numbers hundreds of years before computers ever existed. That mathematical theory of arithmetic layed the foundation for our computational model today. The foundational rules of arithmetic were a bigger, better reason to use transistor states for 1 and 0 digits, and of course the elegance and simplicity of binary also allowed for it to be an easier task to actually build a good computer with. But that's not the only reason computers use binary. It's mostly because binary is good. Any other base is arbitrary based on what humans agree feels good, like say 60 or 10 or 50, or 3.

I am finding the network course very frustrating because of the brief videos. A couple of videos are a bit longer but it seems they tried to keep the length of the videos to around two minutes each. Not sure if this is because people would lose interest quickly but when you are talking about subnetting and how routing works, a short video and a send off to a Wikipedia article is not going to be very helpful to a person brand new to IT.

In one case, we are walked through how a packet travels among the 5 layers (they use a 5 layer model and leave out the Transport and Session layers of the OSI model). When a second packet is described, the instructor says, ""I won't go through the Data Link layer again but just know that stuff is happening"" I was pretty irritated. This is a course designed for people with no IT experience. Was it really too much trouble to add a minute to the video to go through the entire process again for the sake of the student needing repetition?

My larger point is that Google has dropped more projects then they've kept. Their track record isn't great and it's hard to invest in and trust a product from them anymore. They will kill a project if it doesn't millions of users. Reader is the most popular, and overused, example.

According to Wikipedia, they have closer to 68 cancelled services. I also saw references to other services that weren't on the Wikipedia list on other websites, so that list is most likely larger.

Please don't take my comment as a personal attack to you. I think it's a good point to be made that Google tends to kill more services and projects then it keeps around by a larger margin. It makes it difficult to invest in their services.

For instance, I would really like to switch from my Alexas to Homes in my house, but that is a big financial risk for me for something that Google may very well kill in a couple years when people get bored of it as where Amazon tends to keep things around for a long time if they survive the first couple months of life. 

That financial hit could be hundreds or thousands of dollars for me. It goes past the Home devices itself. I have to worry about the time I put into setting everything up along with my own scripts and services I make for my house, training for friends and family, the cost of accessory hardware, etc... That adds up after a couple of years.

Google Fiber and Reader are excellent examples of why I should be worried about this.

Months later, the mutual friend between myself and the hiring official mentioned that he had asked his friend why they never gave me a call back and the guy told him I was one of the most qualified applicants they interviewed, that I actually knew what I was talking about, and that I was in their top 3 for two openings. Openings that still hadn't been filled at that point because they were caught up in red tape.

I had already picked up another job, that give or take was probably on par for workload/compensation, but it was nice to know that I had actually blown that interview out of the water, despite how I walked away from it. 

Reading your comment made me realize that they didn't care that I knew the knowledge to answer the questions in the technical portion of the interview, they actually cared that I knew what questions to ask to figure out a solution (one of my answers was actually ""I don't know, but here's the first thing I would search for in google"").

Just as an addendum, the two questions that I remember from that interview were ""how do you get the serial number of a windows machine using the command line"" which I answered immediately and correctly with ""wmic bios get serialnumber"" and ""you have a server that suddenly stopped connecting to the network, what is your first action?""  On the second one, I answered first with notify the correct people that the server was having issues. They liked the answer, but then specified that they wanted the first troubleshooting step, in which I started asking questions like ""do I have physical access?"" or ""can I check documentation to see if any changes were recently made"", and after a few minutes of that and being at loss for what they wanted me to say, just told them that I would ping 127.0.0.1 (or maybe i said home or localhost) from the server. The guy looked at me and said he'd never actually have anyone give that response (as the first step) to that question before and that it was hands down the exact answer he was looking for.

For a bit of backstory: I recently passed my Security+ after about 6 months of studying this December. I had no previous IT related work experience, just generally someone that spends his days in front of a computer and wanting to pursue a more in depth knowledge. Regardless of where I went (Reddit, game chats, real life, etc), there is like this negative stigma that makes my decision to try something new feel like a fruitless effort. I *wasn't* fortunate enough to be able to finish my college degree. My part time, minimum wage job quickly become next to useless for bills and I needed to stop going to college to get a better paying job and keep a roof above my head for my (future) wife and I.

After spending years in a job that I was quickly growing to hate, I took a friends advice who works in the field, and began studying. It was a grueling grind for months, and the self-doubt EATS you. I wasn't taking this as a part of my college course. I couldn't resort to using my professor as my crutch on something I didn't know. If I didn't succeed it was because *I*, and I alone, failed.

No, I know that my Security+ certification doesn't enable me to be the Chief Security Officer at a company and bring in $100k/yr. But, for someone that is trying desperately to get into this field (and having a lot of trouble), that is ALL I have. The only chance I have is the knowledge I've gained in a ""worthless"" certification, and the self-motivation that got me there. And while it doesn't seem to have much value to the rest of the world (either that, or it's just a bad inside joke), the moment I saw that passing score on the screen meant A LOT. Knowing that the loan I took out to pay for the test (my employer wouldn't pay for it, because it's not a ""college course"") wasn't in vain and that I wouldn't have to find that kind of money again? Never felt so powerful in the world.

The courses I take, and the certifications I receive, are not what make me suited for IT. But hopefully it lets me get in the door somewhere, with someone willing to let me show them WHY I am.

TL;DR - Sure there might be people that use certifications to self-label themselves ""IT Professionals"", but there are those out there that have nothing else but certifications to get a start.

If your boss has an issue with that, then message your boss directly every time she messes with you to ask permission to reprioritize for whatever it is she is demanding.

If she picks you apart in front of people -- try this, when she says something rude, start writing it down, give it a date and timestamp, then ask her to repeat it so you can get your notes correct so that it's (to her) ""done to your specifications"". Then reiterate it -- i.e. ""If I understand correctly, you're saying the site report looks like it could have been written by a 3 year old and that you believe I am not conducting myself appropriately; what you like for me to do to rectify this?""

If she thinks you're incompetent (or whatever it is she's saying) GIVE her incompetent, require specifications for her changes, and make absolutely *sure* that *she* will be happy. Your boss may become uncomfortable about this and ask about it -- you need to be absolutely sure that you are sincere during all of this; it's clearly a problem and you've complained about her demands previously and since no changes were asked of her, for behavior you felt was toxic, that perhaps you've misunderstood and are now adapting to the supported planning matrix she is providing as a project manager.

It is very important you are very detailed in this approach and take it very seriously. I find that following rules to the letter is the only way to get them changed. If this is compliance, and it clearly must be as the business seems to fully support it, be in compliance.

Also, to answer your last question - she does it BECAUSE it hurts and she wants to hurt you. No one is stopping her because they are cowards. Make them work to continue this. Make sure you carry a notebook and take notes for their prioritized shenanigans.

Continue to report things to HR to be filed under ""toxic work environment"". Make sure they're aware of this person and your efforts to try and work with them. Scan the notes to your private email address daily. Always have receipts, keep everything, cover your butt always so that you can copy/paste in response to any new shenanigans. If others do this, give them the same treatment, and if you can get their garbage in writing, in an email, that's the best. Forward those to your personal email also.

Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court, written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., in which the Court ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit, including the intellectually disabled, ""for the protection and health of the state"" did not violate the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The decision was largely seen as an endorsement of negative eugenics—the attempt to improve the human race by eliminating ""defectives"" from the gene pool. The Supreme Court has never expressly overturned Buck v.

What party the alleged offender is working for shouldn't be a deciding factor on whether or not an investigation takes place.

Facebook aren't really selling stuff to the NSA. They were ordered by the NSA (as were Microsoft, Google, Apple, Dropbox, Yahoo etc.) to give them access to their servers. Some companies tried to say no (Yahoo for example) but I don't think that worked long term. The companies were paid for their help in doing this and still are (I think?).

The NSA were found to be making backdoors in some of these companies servers, searching for data which prism missed (~~will try and find source for this, too tired).~~ Source below.

Again, same as above. Google aren't selling it. They're being ordered to comply through secret courts, and being compensated for doing so.

It's not like Flynn doesn't have access to solid legal counsel. If the FBI wants to chat with you, and you're unsure if something you've done was illegal, you know, maybe speak with an attorney. But while we're on this point, if you're unsure if you've done something legally wrong, it's almost a certainty you've done something ethically wrong, at the very least. To use the conservative line, if you don't have anything to hide, you don't have anything to fear. Right? 

>We know what he lied about and we know that he never got or could have gotten charged for anything except the lie itself.

Well no, we don't know that. I have no clue what Flynn was complicit in. Unless you're part of Muller's staff, neither do you.

>The FBI is extremely good at convicting people, even innocent people.

Yes, because Flynn was just some naive guy in way over his head without access to legal representation, right? Just a simple dude that the FBI leaned on until they pressured him into a lie, when in truth, he was as pure as the driven snow. 

>When did he say they shouldn't be investigated because they're Republican? 

I guess listening to the audio in the link I posted was just too much work? Here's the text, if that's easier. 

Rand Paul:
>“**I just don’t think it’s useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party,”** he said. “We’ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do like repealing Obamacare if we’re spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans. I think it makes no sense.”

It should be noted, that he had no such reservations about the Benghazi investigation. That was just fine... I'm the furthest thing from a HRC supporter, but this is just blatant hypocrisy. 

> Even if they got a personal check for billions from Putin, one of those comically large ones, with photo evidence, who cares as long as the policies they want are good ones? Why not talk about what really matters instead?

I honestly do try not to be insulting in my responses, but this is truly one of the stupidest things I've read in a long time. For the sake of this argument, let's completely ignore the fact that a foreign power paying for policy is completely antithetical the the concept of American representative democracy. Let's also ignore the fact that outright pay for policy is very much illegal in America. Let's also ignore the fact that, if President Obama had taken Rubles to shape policy, all Republicans (and most Democrats) would have shit a literal brick. Let's ignore all that. 

What do you think Putin's endgame is here? Do you think he wants to ""Make America Great Again"", or do you think there's an ulterior motive that benefits his own country to the detriment of America? This is like saying 'who cares why the creepy guy in the van is driving around offering free candy to kids. The kids are still getting free candy, right?'

So to answer your question, who cares? I care. Every American who puts party over country cares. Every one of our allies who'd like to see America as a stable and trustworthy partner cares. Every person in the world who appreciates America as a force of occasional good cares. Apparently you don't fit into any of those groups. Though in fairness to you, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find out you're posting from somewhere far outside the United States, where there is no love for America. 

We're done here.

Again, 300 million potential combatants?  What are you smoking?

You don't have 300 million potential combatants man, you have AT MOST 150 million people who think that violently attacking the US is the solution while the other 150 million people (backed by the full force of the US military) thinks that violence is a shitty answer and those people should be shut down.

How many people with rifles does it take to stop a targetted drone strike?  How many guns does some untrained asshole that weighs 350lbs need to stop a tank rolling down his street?

You can't even get 300 million Americans to agree that we shouldn't elect a pedophile to serve as a government official, and you think you can get 300 million Americans to ignore their lives and their families and become outlaws of the state to fight against the US military?

You are living in a dream world dude.  You have zero concept of how something like this would actually play out.

EVEN IF you somehow got millions of people who would be willing to turn to violence to solve their problems (when you can't even get them to get off their asses and fucking vote) that would be when China would come in and take over.  It would take DECADES of fighting, hundreds of millions of people would die in the largest, bloodiest war in the history of human civilization, and our country as we know it would cease to exist.  And then, to stop the violence, China would graciously offer to step in and lend humanitarian aid and impose order on the fractured factions left here in the states and would never leave.

>Again you focus on one single group. They can't do that to 100's or 1000's of individual groups which again would be damn near every small town/ city.

See I don't understand what you're trying to say here.  First, you say it wouldn't have to be organized or big at all.  Now you're talking about hundreds or thousands of individual groups from all across the nation deciding to rise up at the same time and resort to violence WITHOUT some kind of organizing?

For that to happen, the politicians would have to vote against their own self interest in a huge way and again, they would never do that.  All they care about is getting more power and keeping their jobs is the way they do that.  For them to do something bad enough that the entire country just spontaneously gets up and decides to march out the door with their guns to find and kill the politicians is just beyond reason.  No politician would be stupid enough to not see that coming, and no one who saw it coming would vote for it and get it passed knowing that millions of armed people would be coming for them if they did.  It makes no sense.  It's just another circlejerk that gun owners like to think about happening that has less than 0 chance of ever actually occurring.

>Not politicians would vote for that? Right, like Pelosi, McConnell, reed, giffords and many more.

Correct.  None of them would ever vote for something so monumentally stupid that they would enrage millions of Americans to the point of violence.  That's not how it works, that's not how any of this works.

If you think they would do that, you have absolutely no idea how politicians think or how politics works.  Self-preservation is #1 on their list.

The problem is that neither 'taxing work' nor 'rigorous eduxation' are inherently valuable things.

1)  They tend to be terrible negotiators.  

2)  They aren't willing to find new/different jobs.

3)  They have very limited capacity.

This AMA is filled with bad statistic interpretation and some blatant misogyny, so I think I interpreted your comment in that light. 

That’s a really good point you make, that “special treatment also discourages” women from the field. In feminist philosophy, one of the things undergraduates learn a bunch while entering the field is that it’s necessary to look at the larger factors motivating and causing seemingly good things enjoyed by groups.

I would challenge anyone to do a cost/benefit analysis. If you value someone's labor a zero or low cost (i.e. US minimum wage) then yes you may expect A, B, C household duty to be performed.

I make this argument to young mothers when they complain about taking care of their own children and want to work crappy jobs to literally get away from them as they eventually admit. In the US childcare is very expensive, day care averages $211/week or $844 a month which is probably close to the avg mortgage payment. So I say sure if you can produce more than that amount with your labor, plus costs (energy, transportation, time/effort) then yes you should work from an economic standpoint. However they often cannot, as US min wage per month is $1,256.67 before taxes. When I point this out from a strictly fiscal standpoint they blurt out but my kids drive me crazy.

Every generation has always known the media is generally dishonest and not to be trusted. Yet lately we are expected to just accept all the stuff about the wage gap.  Men routinely work crazy hours. I have lived in 6 countries on 3 continents, under 4 dominant religious cultures, some rich some poor. I have never met a woman who routinely puts in 60 hour weeks. I have met probably 20 men who do. Also, as men who amass wealth become more successful with women, they are incentivized to do that. If an otherwise average man could easily get an attractive partner while working normal hours in a normal job, there wouldn't be nearly as much of a wage gap.

The issue I see though is that a lot of highly intelligent women forsake femininity because they don't want to be valued by their femininity as if that's something that is not as valuable. They dislike the fact that society still belittles and underestimates femininity so they specifically try to take on more masculine qualities so that their intelligence becomes their main value such that people take them seriously and don't belittle their competence.

Also, because it tends to happen while someone is in custody of whichever jurisdiction, it tends to be violent criminals with high rates of life-threatening STI's such as hepititis, syphilis, and HIV that are doing the raping.

It is not uncommon for rapists/murderers to be held in county. Often times they run out of room in higher-tier facilities, so they fill the spaces in county/lower tier facilities.

[Study 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/109/41/16474.full.pdf) claims: In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more hireable then the female equivalent. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent.

[Study 2](https://www.docmeeting.com/corti/bejune/cours/mxp/docs2/Ceci_Women_Underrepresentation_Science.pdf) claims: The evidence indicates that women’s preferences, potentially representing both free and constrained choices, constitute the most powerful explanatory factor; a secondary factor is perfor- mance on gatekeeper tests, most likely resulting from sociocultural rather than biological causes.

Critique is regarding the way a task is performed and the overall quality of that performance.  Do you get pushback just delegating tasks themselves?

That's the general idea.  When it comes to critique, you just frame the critique into an aspect that makes sense to the audience (e.g. do it this way and you'll be more efficient [mastery] vs. do it this way and we can meet the client's needs more quickly [purpose] - that's two ways of getting someone to work faster regarding one method, but one is going to resonate more than the other with the individual, and therefore is more likely to be applied autonomously) 

If it's just ""Hey Mark, you did the wrong part"" then you need to determine if it's a motivation issue, an insubordination issue, or a miscomprehension issue, in the first place.

Edit: I think we often fail as leaders because we frame our leadership by our own values rather than that of our audience.

It’s a simple equation, if you make a company more money than they pay you, then you can continue to ask and receive promotions.

Traditional societal jobs, such as teachers, cleaners, garbage men, etc. Don’t ‘make’ profit, therefor they are generally standardized to a livable wage.

If you make your boss a mill a year, it really doesn’t matter what gender you are when asking for a 10k raise.

Now, the fact that some people (statistically women) choose these jobs is generally assumed because they see value in other aspects other than money, they want to help, teach, learn, nurture etc. Or, sometimes, it’s just a stable job that pays the bills with less job stress than what you find in corporate environments.

Should we pay these roles more? Maybe, he’ll, education is really important and I’m sure we all want better quality teachers - but that decision is entirely separate from the fact corporate jobs pay more money to make more money. And traditionally, once these jobs pay more they become competitive, which draws more men into them as they thrive on a competitive nature.

It’s a little disingenuous to claim the wage gap is caused by sexism, when men clearly lose so much from taking higher paying but more stressful jobs (on average). They die sooner, they are generally less happy and more likely to commit suicide.

At the end of the day we all choose our own path, if making more money is important to you then pick a career path that is more lucrative instead of socially rewarding.

How do we know that the choice of profession is not affected by social mores? Or, for that matter, hours worked? If society views women as nurturers, would not it influence such decisions as which parent will stay at work later vs which one will go home to do housework, help kids with school projects and elderly parents and in-laws with chores?

>  If women go into lower paying careers for their own personal reasons, who is to say that's a bad choice?

This is a strawman argument. People are not saying it is a bad choice. The person who chose X instead of Y made the best choice they could in the circumstances with the information they had. They say that it is a choice influenced by society, and as such, should be closely examined and not blithely dismissed as a decision based exclusively on personal preferences, and not affected by salaries, flexibility, availability of daycare, perception of women vs men in certain fields etc.

>  Less than 25 percent of America’s teachers are men. Do we treat it as a societal issue that must be fixed?

I absolutely do, and a lot of people I know do as well. For example, a lot of men that do not go into teaching say that this is because they are afraid of being accused of being a pedophile. How this persisting stereotype of ""men want to be around kids only if they want to have sex with them"" is not a societal issue? And if it is not, in fact, a stereotype, is not that a problem as well?

To address your first point -- as a counter point based on a similar sample size of one, I felt the opposite pressure in college. I wanted to major in english and become a teacher. I was pressured to major in business -- more specifically, Decision and Information Sciences which was overwhelmingly male. I'm curious to know whether it was your parents pressuring you (as was the case in my story) or larger cultural messages from the media, etc.?

I'm not sure I understand your point about the conflicting messages in my articles so I'm not exactly sure how to address it. My point in the STEM article is that we should stop making value judgments which say women's choices are somehow less worthwhile than men's. In the wage gap article, my point is somewhat different: money and hierarchical rank are bad measures to use to judge female progress because they don't account for the trade offs entailed in those choices. I don't see how those points are conflicting but happy to clarify further if you have more specific questions.

To answer your question at the end: I don't think we need to put pressure on women (or anyone) to make certain career choices. People should be exposed to all their options and have the freedom to make their own choices. I don't get why we feel it's necessary to get more women in STEM if it's not something they want to do. 

As for the bonus question, I don't think it's the right question to be asking. I think the question is, 'what do women want and how do we help them toward that end.' Instead we've been asking 'how do we get more women into XYZ fields?' which is based on the assumption that that's what's best for them. I find it condescending. It's built on the presumption that women don't know what they want without people's help.

And for the record I agree with you! I too believe people should value cooperation over competitiveness and that the system needs to make changes. But if we are going to go about that, we can't start doing it by trying to understand how things currently are in terms of how we think they should be.

If you cannot agree that competition is in human nature then consider this: is there ever a point in any competitive situation where there isn't some incentive? Take anything, a sport, video game, board game, competition, exam, promotion, position, etc. There is always an incentive to win no matter what. I like to play games. There isn't anyone to give me a trophy if I beat someone in Rocket League, but I still love winning because it makes me feel accomplished inherently. It is literally hardwired into my brain that I love to win. I don't need some asshole handing me dollar bills to love to win.

My point with all of that is, yes, of course people compete with each other because of external incentive, which is, in the case of virtually any economy, money and shit. But you also have to keep in mind that there is some internal component to us that makes us want all of that shit, you know?

Tl;dr: I agree with you that people shouldn't use human nature as an excuse for being selfish assholes and being repulsed by the idea of change. What I am saying is that you can't neglect that human nature is selfish and you can't argue against that fact by saying there is some objective point to humanity that lies in cooperation.

I know somebody who is probably a nutcase at this point. I'm not saying you're like this guy, but please consider it a cautionary tale.

So this guy walked around telling people they're wrong and he's right, often in a rude manner, with a lot of unnecessary name dropping, and a lot of needlessly putting other people down. When people talked back in a similar tone he felt insulted and escalated into more and more direct attacks. So very soon everybody was doing their best to avoid talking to him or giving him a chance to express his views (his views were mostly stupid, but I think that might be a consequence of his behavior rather than the source of the problem: since he never considered that he might be wrong, he kept entrenching himself further and further into extreme views). So anyway, eventually somebody higher up in the hierarchy was brought in to tell him to calm down, he claimed he was being suppressed by jealous people.

Obviously this guy is now out of a job and seems to be generally struggling in life. Yet he keeps on blaming it on other people. I went out of my way to try and help him but he pushed me away on the ground that I, too, am a jealous insecure person. Since he's been known to be threatening/violent, I'm now leaving him to continue his solitary descent into madness.

Again, I'm not saying you're that guy, or that you're even close to being that guy. It's possible that you're in a really bad environment, and that you are really surrounded by jealous insecure people.

I'm a divorced single 31yo man for context. My biggest gripe with it is that it seems to have killed femininity. I find women that adhere to traditionally more feminine qualities with regards to dress and personality (empathy, kindness, emotional sensitivity, family focused, etc...) attractive. The people I associate with don't seem to embody this at all so I just don't find them attractive which is why I've been struggling. 

Don't get me wrong, I respect the women and consider them my equal but I find they are people I can be good friends with rather than people I am interested in romantically. I could never love them given their personalities. The way I've tried to communicate this to people is that I feel women have simply coopted masculine qualities while vilifying feminine qualities. I don't find men attractive romantically so when women become more like men, I simply find them less attractive. I work in banking so almost every woman I surround myself with are well educated in a business oriented job which I find to be the worst environment for what I'm speaking of.

My point is that I think modern feminism has failed. Rather than make femininity equal to men, women have simply become more like men and even women themselves, who've embodied these masculine qualities, discriminate against feminine women. In the quest for equality women have lost their uniqueness, or for my own selfish reasons, they've lost the very essence about them which is what made me attracted to them in the first place.

Anyone who says 'if women do more low paying jobs it's proof of oppression' is clearly an ideologue in over their head. Obviously men and women will have different interests. Women have more empathy and not men find more pleasure out of money than women. So obviously men will do more to chase money. 

Women on average also have softer personalities, by this I mean on average. There's also been studies that have stated that women later in life are far more unhappy if they used their entire life to chase their career than to have a family but with lower pay. 

I'm an advocate for choosing what you wish to do with your life, but the feminist myth that the only reason women earn less is due to oppression is unfounded. The irony about feminism is that they want all women to be the same, chase careers and let men take the backseat?

 Feminism has long not been about equality, because equality doesn't look at equal outcome. Men and women are inherently different, so you can't expect the same outcome when the variables that go in aren't the same.

The questions are supposed to be rhetorical but they're obviously not making the point intended so I'll elaborate. If my argument was that women prefer the color green and men prefer the color red, nobody would give a fuck. nobody would get all angry and say ""BUT CULTURE MAKES WOMEN LIKE GREEN."" the only difference between a statement like ""more women prefer green while more men prefer blue"" and the statement ""more women prefer nursing and more men prefer engineering,"" is the object of desire. and the only reason why one would get upset about the latter and not the former, is because they're making some value judgement about what women prefer. they're essentially saying that women would make different (ie. better) choices if they weren't influenced by culture. so that's why I ask -- i'm pointing out that the only reason we see this as an issue is because of the value judgment. We assume women only choose nursing (FOR EXAMPLE PURPOSES ONLY) because that was a profession historically associated with women. It assumes women are still enslaved by history and don't have the same free agency as men. I'm pointing out how condescending and dis-empowering that is.

That is enlightening and I love the conclusion you came to. I fully agree with with you for the most part!

And I'm on mobile, so excuse what may seem like a short response. 

I grew up in South Florida where every single science teacher in my formative years (6th to 8th) was female. And 2 out of my 3 math teachers were female. And it was better in high school. I don't think I was ever told by a teacher that girls don't do science, and that is a blessing because my interest in STEM grew *very* strong  in middle school.

However, despite my experiences, I have heard (and I'm reading on this thread) instances of people discouraging the females. Or even how marketing/advertising in society made things delicate and pink for women (I personally feel like the tide is changing on that a bit... but diff topic). So unfortunately it does happen.

I very much agree with you that parental leave not being the norm is a big part of the problem. I personally, always knew I'd be career driven. BUT, currently looking down the barrell of my late 20s, knocking on 30 and I'm reevaluating the choices I made because my current line of work may not be sustainable (and not being made easier) for the person I'd like to be when I am a mother. Fact of the matter is, when women take time off for children, they often risk/take an L in career advancement. 

But what about women that forego parenthood or push it off until way later to climb in their careers? They still get looks for not wanting to be married or have kids (at the time or at all). And when you're good at your career and single, you get flack for it. 

I hear and am talking to a few companies that are trying to better that, to create a path back--*within* STEM. But it's still a thing. 

I think it's many things. And I believe you could lump parental leave with pressures and call it a lack of societal support.

It is always easier for your values, beliefs and overall personality to align with the conventions of society than it is to not align.

It was easier to believe the Earth was flat than round at one point in time even though that wasn't the truth. Many people believed the former because that was the convention at the time. You adopt this convention without questioning it and you feel no pressure from adopting it. The pressure is only when you take the view that the Earth is actually round. Now in our society it is the reverse that is true. This is the point I was trying to get at, not that feminism is an authoritarian regime. That convention is always easier to follow and many people don't even realize all they're doing is adopting the convention.

It's easier to believe in democracy in a democracy. While someone in a dictatorship might believe in a dictatorship. One is not inherently more natural than the other but the conventions of the society will dictate which values are easier to have.

I think you're just a little too unaware of just how society has actually shaped you. ""Like you want to behave"" is immensely influenced by the society you grew up within as well as the biological and at times one can dominate the other without anyone realizing it.

(Interesting fact: the state of California tried to make having sex with someone that is drunk/high/on drugs actual, prosecutable ""sexual assault,"" with jail time, sex offender status, and everything, but they gave up when they realized that made a massive percent of the population would be prosecuted. No way could they keep you with a case load like that. They would issue more sex offense convictions than parking tickets.)

I guess it is necessary for me to define what I mean by forceable rape once more, because you have either forgotten or missed it the first time (or maybe I said something misleading/inaccurate).


Forceable rape:

Using threats or physical force to coerce someone into vaginal/anal sex.


One thing I have found is that the vast majority of pretty much all crimes tend to be men. They usually REALLY ARE the victims in most cases. Men are BY FAR the most common murder victims, for instance. This makes sense when you think about everything. Men seem to be way more likely to put themselves in the situation to get murdered. Men tend to be risk takers and women tend to be risk aversive.

I already told you the statistics on males being forced to penetrate being 4.8% in the GENERAL POPULATION (again, not counting those that are penetrated) and in prison ""being raped in their current facility"" (not ever, just in their current facility) is 7% of the prison population (in one sample).

The problem with our society these days as we keep racing down this path of degeneration, is that people with control and power simply cannot get over themselves and will never let go of their obsessive conviction that they, they themselves are the benevolent dictator that can solve all problems for everyone else even far better than anyone could ever do for themselves, especially if people dare not accept that they are doing it all ""for your own good"".

I just read your linked article on women in STEM and was curious about the viewpoint you presented. I wanted to see it as a call to acknowledge the fields that women are more dominant in and celebrate those areas, but I found it a bit dismissive of the social phenomenon that you mention Katie Couric has spoken about. 

As a woman that studied psychology, I’m a bit ashamed to admit that I actually switched majors from a “harder” science. While I love my degree and enjoyed my studies, I know that as a confused and impressionable college student I felt passively discouraged from studying in a field where I would be a gender minority, and was encouraged to pursue areas that were more female-centric.

Obviously, I’m a sample size of one and you could certainly point to my own maturity at the time as a factor in not fighting the stereotypes, or whatever you might call that pressure. But I’m sure I’m not the only one that has had that experience, or seen my male cohorts in school be actively encouraged to “fall back” on more lucrative majors. 

When I read your article about the wage gap being more attributed to the different careers and business sectors between genders, not necessarily from sexism in the payroll department, I found the 2 articles somewhat conflicting. It seems the STEM article is asking us to celebrate the areas that women choose(?) to dominate (although in my personal experience, it might not be completely a choice), and those areas can be equally but differently important than male-dominated fields; while the Wage Gap article seems to be saying that the wage gap is because of this choice to work in those fields, or take time off for family, etc. and is therefore understandable that women are paid less/men are paid more overall. The latter article also states that men would be paid less if they took the same flexibility in work as women do. 

My question is: How do we overcome the societal pressure for women like myself to study a softer, more flexible industry, and therefore make less in the long run? Or, how do we encourage more men to not (perhaps) default to STEM or banking while women default to social sciences and nursing? (Excuse the gross exaggeration, but you get the idea). 

Bonus question: if all of the above fields and careers paid exactly the same, do you think we would have a more equal distribution between genders across them?

On one hand, you say things like you finally understood that the grandstanding about helping women is a lie and the truth is about personal power and agendas.

But If women are more motivated by cooperation, then why not  change the structure from being exclusively a zero sum game? ""

I actually read about this responding to another redditor. For example:

""Between 30 and 50 percent of programmers were women in the 1950s, and it was seen as a natural career

one of the Navy’s few rear admirals in 1986, about 37% of computer science undergrads were still women

By 2011, the percentage of women in computer science programs had fallen to 17%""

That redditor said that this is because of women's lack of interest but failed to mentioned that women were basically pushed out. 
So then the articles mentioned what happened and I think the main reason is that the male programmers didn't want to be in a career with lots of women because they knew they would make less money so by pushing them out they can increase their pay rate. 

""What changed? Well, male programmers wanted to elevate their job out of the “women’s work” category. They created professional associations and discouraged the hiring of women. Ads began to connect women staffers with error and inefficiency. They instituted math puzzle tests for hiring purposes that gave men who had taken math classes an advantage, and personality tests that purported to find the ideal “programming type.” Frink writes:

According to test developers, successful programmers had most of the same personality traits as other white-collar professionals. The important distinction, however, was that programmers displayed “disinterest in people” and that they disliked “activities involving close personal interaction.” It is these personality profiles, says Ensmenger, that originated our modern stereotype of the anti-social computer geek.

Employers began comparing programming less to clerical work and more to masculine activities like playing chess. Ad campaigns criticized women as gossiping, time-wasting, and error-prone. One tagline for Optical Scanning Corporation Ran, “What has sixteen legs, eight waggly tongues and costs you at least $40,000 a year?” Your team of 8 female programmers, that’s what.

Hiring mangers began administering aptitude and personality profile tests that were biased toward men. The answers were circulated to fraternities and men’s clubs like the Elks.

One of they key takeaways of the personality tests was the best programmers were antisocial, and that that was a male trait""",2592,testimonial injustice,http www google com amp www history com amp news cod use woman job pay less undervalued http www smithsonianmag com smart news computer program use woman work 718061 https www google com amp timeline com amp p c2959b822523 actually read respond another redditor example 30 50 percent programmer woman 1950s see natural career one navy rear admiral 1986 37 computer science undergrad still woman 2011 percentage woman computer science program fall 17 redditor say woman lack interest fail mention woman basically push article mention happen think main reason male programmer want career lot woman know would make less money push increase pay rate change well male programmer want elevate job woman work category create professional association discourage hire woman ad begin connect woman staffer error inefficiency institute math puzzle test hire purpose give men take math class advantage personality test purport find ideal program type frink write accord test developer successful programmer personality trait white collar professional important distinction however programmer display disinterest people disliked activity involve close personal interaction personality profile say ensmenger originate modern stereotype anti social computer geek employer begin compare program less clerical work masculine activity like play chess ad campaign criticize woman gossip time waste error prone one tagline optical scan corporation run sixteen leg eight waggly tongue cost least 40 000 year team 8 female programmer hire manger begin administer aptitude personality profile test bias toward men answer circulate fraternity men club like elks one key takeaways personality test best programmer antisocial male trait,"feel, like, manager, engineering, job",0.8055528218681202,"inexperienced, bitterness, belittling, dismissing, ostracism",0.04,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.4019367490705786

It is very unclear how connected societal outcomes are causal with biology. Clearly biology is the fundamental underpinning of acting like a human. But part of that is the use of culture to do things that are opposed to our natural desires. Paradoxically, this too is natural. So when you have an outcome in an incredibly complex system, like gender differences in various occupations, the gender pay gap, etc., it is very difficult to tease out. So when feminists make absurd claims that any difference in gender outcomes is patriarchy, they cannot be right. Some of it has to be biological sex differences. But equally wrong is looking at one of these outcomes and declaring that because of some handful of traits I put in a memo that I think favor working in STEM, men should be dominant. Both are bullshit. No one can tell you or me the natural rate of women in STEM in a certain society. And the research you are citing, while important and evidence that certain feminists need to look harder at the data, doesn't really tell us this natural rate. It also doesn't tell us why, which is multi-causal and clearly dependent on culture. That's literally what it studied. 

Here's what we know. For thousands of years, women were forbidden certain occupations, face workplace harassment in male dominated fields, and had many restrictions codified into law and enforced by social norms. You see this in less egalitarian countries, like much of the Middle East, right now. In the West, we've had movements that have rid women of many of these restrictions. The legal changes are easily measurable and obvious. But the societal changes are murky and analyzing them is fraught with bias. So claiming that what is happening right now is simply natural because we are more egalitarian than before, isn't an evidenced-based claim. 

I'm not an economist, but [here is an example of an academic economist confronting Jordan Peterson with his misuse of the evidence and the complexity of the issue.](https://publicintegrity.org/federal-politics/elections/fbi-tracked-alleged-russian-mob-ties-of-giuliani-campaign-supporter/]) I think that elucidates what I'm trying to say here. Is there discrimination against women? Yes. Does it affect genders differences in occupations? Yes. Is it as much as the past? No. How much does it affect it? Far less than in the past, but it's hard to tell because choice of occupation is loaded with societal influences by both women and men.

I‘m saying it’s not what it’s supposed to be.

This, too, is what I'm saying, but not in general, just in your specific case.

I publish security whitepapers on how to manage new devices in secure environments. I do it on a pretty regular basis, at least a few times a year. These papers are peer reviewed. Not checked for grammar, not checked for spelling, not checked for controversy, they are ***peer reviewed*** for accuracy and completeness. They get published in a private security journal, and the way we get people to pay for journal access is by having a competent system of peer review. Peer review works, it's that simple.

Your problem, the problem you have experienced, is that papers submitted for peer review *are not* peer reviewed, and instead have something else done to them. What, exactly, is unpredictable, but the only thing I've gathered from the data you've presented is that they aren't getting a peer review.

>The reviews I had are what passes for reviews at the middling Level throughout academia in my field of study.

We both agree that this is a problem.

>You are the first person who has argued otherwise.

No, I didn't. I said that peer review, as a concept, is not broken. Your obvious lack of reading comprehension in this thread does not speak well to your personal ability to conduct a peer review, either. Maybe that's why peer review is broken in your industry - because Humanities majors do not read correctly, or do not want to. I don't know. I didn't say anything about that either.

>How much do peer reviews get paid? 0. How much do authors make on their publications? Usually zero

Sounds like a problem with the journals you publish in. Maybe make a new journal and try to fix that? Or complain on the internet I guess. Doesn't change the fact that peer review is alive and well in tons of industries, and I get paid for the peer reviews I do and the whitepapers I publish.

I have had bad experiences with peer review, don't get me wrong. I've submitted poor-quality peer reviews I've received to the journals I publish in so that the peer reviewers are flagged as bad and not paid for their review on my article. In a couple of cases I have had people removed from the peer review panel I am on for not reviewing correctly (usually by making assumptions about things they don't know and stating them as fact, never for having corrected spelling and grammar in lieu of a peer review).

I have never personally *seen* a woman fired for anything, ever, from a professional/office job. The more I think about it, I haven't even seen one laid off despite myself being laid off twice in fifteen years.

Years back a woman evidently got a little mental during a lengthy divorce proceeding she initiated and called the township police because she heard a ticking sound late one day in the office and thought it was a bomb. I did not witness the response so I do not know if the bomb squad came out or not, but I do know the police did respond and she was placed on some kind of leave for at least two weeks and informally it was made known not to mention the incident to her. 

My old boss, who was a lesbian, made the most vulgar man like jokes to everyone and she spent thirteen years at this place (everyone on the team was a man except her, we really didn't care). Later after leaving our company for a director position elsewhere I heard she was terminated after six months on the nose but I never found out why exactly and have not seen her since 2014. 

During the same role, I had a female QA call me out of the blue at 9pm to discuss some code I wrote which she had to test. I don't remember the exact conversation but it was short and at the end she flipped and screamed into the phone and I quote ""a monkey could do your job better than you"" before hanging up. I laugh about it now but it was the only time ever I went to a boss about any problem with a co-worker in fifteen years. This woman was apparently reprimanded and shortly after there was a reorg and she was made a ""tech writer"" which is not a job in which she was qualified (all management of our department was female at the time). I approached the QA and explained I looked forward to learning from her about Product X, to which she smiled and apologized for the incident (her mother had cancer and she had some role in the mother's care, I don't remember what). Wisely she took the hint of her reprimand and left about six weeks later for another QA role. Any man would have been put on a performance plan, i.e. probation, or or more likely terminated on the spot - not given another chance in some made up job which gave her time and benefits to make an exit. I say this as someone that was laid off in July and did not work again till September, would have been very fucking nice to appreciate the time I put in there and give me a warning about the lay off so I could have had benefits after July.

You're right that patriarchy doesn't operate as a handful of wealthy white men making up ways to oppresses women, because patriarchy is, by definition, "" [a social system in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. In the domain of the family, fathers or father-figures hold authority over women and children. ...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy) ""


Toxic masculinity is a product of the patriarchy. It tells men they can't have feelings other than anger or agrression, that they have to be self reliant and that this is 'strength'. This is what leads to men not seeking medical care until it's too late, men being less likely to seek mental health help (maybe this is why they're more likely to successfully commit suicide?), etc. 

The following two paragraphs is copy pasted from the sidebar of r/MensLib which i think you would find agrees with most of your views on how the patriarchy affects men. I know that it might be hard to get past the fact that you don't believe in the patriarchy but I still recommend taking a look through the sub in good faith. Whether you believe in the system or not you have clearly pointed out that you understand its effects on men in society. I think most feminists also agree that men suffer under the system and there are less differences between their views and yours. 


- ""[Feminist theory defines patriarchy as an unjust social system that enforces gender roles and is oppressive to both men and women. It often includes any social, political, or economic mechanism that evokes male dominance over women. ...Prior to the widespread use of ""patriarchy"", feminists used the terms ""male chauvinism"" and ""sexism"" to refer roughly to the same phenomenon. Author bell hooks argues that the new term identifies the ideological system itself (that men are inherently dominant or superior to women) that can be believed and acted upon by either men or women, whereas the earlier terms imply only men act as oppressors of women.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy#Feminist_theory)

- Although patriarchy generally bestows men with privilege compared to other genders, it does not benefit all men. Patriarchy establishes a hierarchy of identities, which is topped by men who best embody the identity of: wealthy, heterosexual, cisgendered, able-bodied, masculine men of the local racial majority. Each divergence from that preferred type of person results in new forms of oppression (see Intersectionality).

Rich, upper-level management at the district and state levels make MORE money when they spend less money on the basics required to educate a child.  The more money they can shave off of basic operations, the more perks and padding to their payroll they can allocate.  

I do imply the admin of our distracts and even boards of regents for higher education are nearly entirely male here in the South by Southwest.  Not much has changed since the 1950s and our educational system is one of those ""dog eat dog"" situations where only the most manipulative and proactive of students use their OUTSIDE resources to transcend poverty and get a higher education.  Or the kids whose parents are rich enough to send them to private school. 

They literally made it out because they learn how to manipulate, sneak behind, and finesse the system.  They learn real quick how to get the worst teachers to do what they want and often end up doing things a ""good"" person would consider ethically and morally reprehensible.  The kids who are smart, but don't have that savvy are left in the dust.

And the same goes for our teachers - most good teachers left this state because of corruption and low salary. And despite having family here or life here, they had to pull up roots to survive the consistent efforts of people of a higher income level taking money away from students and teachers to fund their luxuries which they accept as ""normal"" perks of being in upper management.

Women are taught at a young age to be nice, compassionate, and put others in front of them.  And the men who grown up the same environments come to expect that from women as a whole.  Passivity and accepting your lot in life is a low-income value. 

As ""good"" teachers - we have to implement those same horrible ""not-nice"" skills to get what we want and need to operate a normal classroom. Or most just give up, do a half-ass or completely incompetent job, or quit and find another field.  What is left is people who hate children and people who are too desperate for money to leave an unsustainable, toxic school/work environs (and of course the pedos who sneak in during emergency credential hires to groom and molest child WHOM WE END UP WORKING WITH) 

The most horrible thing we learn as women and in low-income situations is to ""take it."" Teachers learn to take abuse.  Teachers don't ask for money that is actually budgeted for things they need because they are afraid or don't think it is there.  They don't look at the trickle-down, vendors, contracts, and the constant quid quo pro going on between these agencies to low-ball everything from school food to building upkeep.

And then, as an example of this, in the most impoverished school districts, they'll watch their superintendents shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars to build a football stadium and fund the 2-year sports careers of a group of male students which compromise 1/16th of their school population.  Over and over. 

(And literally, outside of teamwork and camaraderie) high school football isn't changing the lives, education, salaries, and overall quality of life of a whole school.

You are literally lying to yourself and rationalizing while denouncing a source that cites other sources of primary research. Which, even if, as all the honest and intelligent people know, are not accurate or precise, still point in very different directions that that women and men are the same thing; regardless of the obvious differences that anyone that is not mentally deranged and ill can clearly see on first observation. The fact that you would cite wikipedia (presumably) as a credible source, while denouncing a book that had paid researchers verify information prior to publication and also cites all the sources necessary to validate the claims made by a certified and experienced neuro-psychiatrist, is just more proof that you are utterly brainwashed. Wikipedia is nothing more than a vehicle for the delivery of propaganda as payload of otherwise credible information. It's the age old trick of wrapping propaganda lies in mostly-truths to hook the educated idiot fools. 

And of course you fools eat it up hook, line, sinker, rod, and reel; while floating in pretension. Keep on keeping on with that ignorance. You do it so well. 

Try finding a reference to the french report on the terrorist muslim Bataclan attack and how they utterly mutilated and slaughtered and butchered the people (slicing women's genitalia and cutting the male's genitalia off and stuffing them in their mouths, etc.) in that building that was revealed as part of court proceedings. yeah, you won't find it and you will not be able to post a link to it, let alone cite it or mention the findings.

You really have not been paying attention over the last several decades, have you. A recent study of studies revealed that the vast majority of studies are never replicated and those that are attempted to be reproduced are unsuccessfully reproduced, even leading to several high profile scandals that are suppressed as quickly as they are made public.  The worst offenders are of course the social ""sciences"" where ~80% of studies were not reproducible in any manner, before anyone could even attempt reproducing the results. 

What I find most interesting about you mentally ill and deranged educated idiot cult types is that you are so unable to suspend your brainwashed bias. You are so sick that you need positive affirmation through a procedural exercise to then ignore what does not confirm your preconceived notions (believe it or not, it does not take a peer reviewed study to confirm that water makes things wet), which you will then promptly and summarily dismiss if your masters and handlers at ""university"" cult headquarters have brainwashed you into believing otherwise.

I’ve only received 1 minor negative technical feedback remark since I started and feel like I’m doing solid mid level work yet I’m repeatedly not acknowledged in person or on Slack. Like treated like I’m invisible and am unable to answer questions, help, etc. Been told I’m too opinionated. And also that I should speak up more. And stop being reactionary (I was only “reactionary” once) because it’ll make me a better leader. But also told “it’s just rank” when I do bring up feeling invisible...I’m titled as junior at 5 years of job experience. And then an engineer coworker was starting to bully me and with this particular guy, it’s highly likely it’s based in sexism (he’s made #notallmen comments amongst other things). I’ve never seen/heard him talk like this to any guys. He regularly also ignored me despite sitting on the other side of his desk. He also makes really offensive “jokes”. This situation just resolved with HR after months of inaction and gaslighting and after I escalated to offsite HR. I guess he’s being punished because he’s not at work and his tasks have been reassigned. Note: the bully went to HR first, not me. 

A male coworker has gotten credit for helping my manager and a lead even though I also helped (he physically showed them what I verbally said to do). That was also after my manager, who assigned me to the feature I was working on, failed to ask me for help and it was also about some code I actually wrote. I injected myself only because he was at coworkers desk next to mine and I overheard.

The only female senior IC on my team is looking at early retirement because she hates all of this. No one ever listens to her. She says this is the worst job and the sexism and bias feels worse than ever. She almost started crying last time we talked.

About a third of women (eng, qa, design) left the team since I started a bit over a year ago. Other women are also looking to leave, there aren’t many left. Only female QA person has been learning to code and handles all the server QA yet she had to go to HR for help to be able to get a handful of QE tasks assigned to her after being rejected for the now recently filled QE role that she already supports. Her manager micromanages her to death even though she’s doing great work and provides so much value for what she’s being paid. 

Frequent dumb comments/assumptions like asking me if I have a nail file (why not ask in team chat), being surprised when I don’t freak out about a spider on my chair, etc. Referring to my engineering discipline as “server dudes” when we have 4 whole women. These just get old.

Someone also reported something to HR on my behalf without talking to me and it destroyed my relationship with the coworker that was reported. He was at worst borderline unprofessional but I didn’t have a problem with anything personally. He was super supportive of me which I never had at work previously and since then he withdrew from the team completely which is a huge loss because he is the type to push for newer, better things. 

Second day in this job at happy hour, a guy got wasted and hit on the female intern in front of me. He was really in her face and she was visibly uncomfortable. She escaped and then he started to do the same to me but I left too. Some other women on the team said this guy has done shit like this before. He has a girlfriend.

Also, try not to project on others what you are, dog. 

But the rhetoric sparring aside, if you don't understand how fighting commies and busting trans-global corporations relates, you really should start informing yourself about the things these evil people have you supporting. There is a particular bifurcation in the ""communist"" ideology that goes way back and is most (which still means not at all) known as the menshevik strategy relative to the bolshevik strategy (which a few more people may at the very least know from anecdote, even if they don't understand the precise underlying strategy), which essentially is the difference between busting in and taking over and destroying everything in order to rebuild society from the rubble (the bolshevik strategy), opposite to the strategy of surreptitiously infiltrating, taking over, infesting, spreading, entrenching oneself and then from within, like cancer or an alien virus eating away and collapsing and taking over and slowly turn the host more into an alien than a human, in order to use the system against itself to destroy it and bring about utter destruction and takeover and bring about the collapse of the whole engine that has produced everything we have and enjoy (the Menshevik strategy).  

They are of course both strategies to bring about utter destruction and total collapse of life and humanity in a foolish pursuit of a delusional con artist lie of a utopia that will of course never come for the regular people who are mere puppets and tools that are manipulated by the psychopaths that lust to replace the current ruling psychopaths, but ruin it will bring with 100% certainty for everyone, especially those poor who the fools believe they will help. 

What you are not understanding is that the immense consolidation and concentration of power in the tech companies (most obviously) and in countries (the USA most obviously) is pushing us towards a dystopian world of total, global tyranny by a tiny little global ruling aristocracy that will be using the global 5G type systems for total control and monitoring along with automation and digitization to utterly crush anyone that defies them with next to no way to fight such overwhelming power.  And unfortunately, the saddest part is that the fools the ruling classes and their challengers are wrestling over to control as their minions and armies, are going to only enable that global world domination in a manic state of delusion that they are helping themselves and whatever bleeding heart virtue signaling ""victim"" they seek to ""help"".

The thing people never seem to realize is that the ""slavery"" that is always bandied around in lieu of intellect and logic, was socialism/communism … the masters managed the workers' lives and took care of them medically, fed them, allocated their work and provided the same equally to all, and even took care of them in their old age, as codified in law.

You just want to be right no matter what, which is why you are trying to shut down this conversation because you know are worried my argument may stengthen (maybe, or it may weaken... Depends on the data, now doesn't it?) as I uncover more data. YOU don't want to have to admit to being wrong. The 4.8% figure is ALSO part of ""the data"" and it is also the most publicly available data (because it's what is published on Wikipedia, so that's what most people will see) and was the only one I was aware of until I read this study. I'm trying to figure out why this number (1.7%) is way lower than the more widely-known number (4.8%). I think that definitely requires more data and research. Saying the 1.7 figure is ""right"" and the 4.8 figure is ""wrong"" would be doing EXACTLY what you accused me of: looking for data to justify your position. Maybe the 1.7 is right. Maybe it's 1.5? Maybe it's 5.3? I'm still looking into it. I'm gonna go get more info on these studies, and look at more studies.

Questioning the validity of other elements of this study (not dismissing them, but being a bit skeptical) is quite reasonable (again, I'm NOT dismissing the data... I don't think they are bald-faced lying about the results) since they are not differentiating forced vaginal sex from consentual so long as you are drunk/high/drugged/unconscious. Like I said this is (was?) legit, prosecutable rape in California. This is a common argument that would not hold up at most cocktail parties and water coolers (and probably anywhere that isn't super-liberal) and only works in court because it is codified into the law. Even then, like I said, it DIDN'T work, because that would make most of the population both a rape victims AND a rape perpetrator. And notice the other questions in that same question block add the term forced or say that someone made you do it... Except for the vaginal part, or the oral part(s). Interesting. Very suspicious that they didn't add the word ""forced"" to the vaginal part. Is there something about vaginal sex that makes it extra ""rapey"" versus anal? Hell, if anything, if you are gonna call all of a certain type of sex rape so long as you are drug-alcohol addled, I would go for anal, not vaginal, wouldn't you? Same with the mouth on the penis thing. Why didn't they ask about coercion there? Or have a separate question for each, one for forced and one for consentual? Oh that's right, because drunken sex can't be consentual, according to their definition. This is exactly what you would do if you wanted to turn fairly normal things into ""rape"" so that you could throw up higher numbers to scare people, but have a defensible excuse (it wasn't consensual because they were ""impaired,"" therefore rape).

So this makes me want to go through every single bit of this study with a fine-toothed comb and a slightly skeptical eye. Going into this, did you think you would be considered a rapist AND a rape victim? I bet not. Are you, according to this study? I bet so. Do I think you are/were ACTUALLY raped? No, and neither does anybody you know, probably, using this study's twisted criteria for ""consent.""

Can you imagine asking someone that just slept with a hot chick at a frat party if they were raped and having them answer ""yes because I was drunk?""

I can't even fathom that.

Think about it. 19%? I bet you know 100 women. Do you REALLY THINK 20 of those women were legit raped? It seems artificially high to me.

Just so you know I am going to continue looking into the data, and will probably read another 20-30 more studies before I even begin to think that I have a solid comprehension of the subject. There are just so many variables here... This is not an easy thing. I mean 1.7 versus 4.8? That's a huge difference.

Time to figure out why! Were the 4.8% people flat-out lying? I bet not. I mean 4.8% is still slightly under 1 in 20, but it is almost 3x higher than 1.7, so, I'm off to figure out what the deal with that is.

When I said that the number seems more like 11%, I wasn't talking about a different study. I was talking about the same study, but not including the ""drug facilitated"" part (which was about 9%). I'm still trying to figure out how they calculated the 11% (the average of 10-12%) in their data-set. Try called it ""forced completed penetration"" in the study, and 11% of women reported that happening at least once in their lifetime.

The devil is in the details on this study FOR SURE, because they are clearly calling things rape that others (including you and I) would not think they are talking about when they say ""rape.""",4673,testimonial injustice,try find data support position want right matter try shut conversation know worried argument may stengthen maybe may weaken depends data uncover data want admit wrong 4 8 figure also part data also publicly available data publish wikipedia people see one aware read study try figure number 1 7 way low widely know number 4 8 think definitely require data research say 1 7 figure right 4 8 figure wrong would exactly accuse look data justify position maybe 1 7 right maybe 1 5 maybe 5 3 still look gon na go get info study look study question validity element study dismiss bit skeptical quite reasonable dismiss data think bald face lie result since differentiate force vaginal sex consentual long drunk high drug unconscious like say legit prosecutable rape california common argument would hold cocktail party water cooler probably anywhere super liberal work court codify law even like say work would make population rape victim rape perpetrator notice question question block add term force say someone make except vaginal part oral part interest suspicious add word force vaginal part something vaginal sex make extra rapey versus anal hell anything gon na call certain type sex rape long drug alcohol addle would go anal vaginal mouth penis thing ask coercion separate question one force one consentual oh right drunken sex consentual accord definition exactly would want turn fairly normal thing rape could throw high number scare people defensible excuse consensual impaired therefore rape make want go every single bit study fine toothed comb slightly skeptical eye go think would consider rapist rape victim bet accord study bet think actually rap neither anybody know probably use study twist criterion consent imagine ask someone sleep hot chick frat party rap answer yes drink even fathom think 19 bet know 100 woman really think 20 woman legit rap seem artificially high know go continue look data probably read another 20 30 study even begin think solid comprehension subject many variable easy thing mean 1 7 versus 4 8 huge difference time figure 4 8 people flat lie bet mean 4 8 still slightly 1 20 almost 3x high 1 7 figure deal say number seem like 11 talk different study talk study include drug facilitate part 9 still try figure calculate 11 average 10 12 data set try call force complete penetration study 11 woman report happen least lifetime devil detail study sure clearly call thing rape others include would think talk say rape,"feel, like, manager, engineering, job",0.8055528218681202,"inexperienced, bitterness, belittling, dismissing, ostracism",0.04,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.4794616598775138

I see I'm way off topic from my original comment but I like this discussion anyway...

I think you feel no pressure ""to be masculine"" because these qualities are qualities that haven't been highlighted as ""bad"" or specific traits that you should take-note-of or avoid. There is no pressure because the stream of societal convention has been crafted such that adopting these traits are the path of least resistance for you such that you don't feel any pressure accepting them. You don't need to feel pressure for there to be pressure and in fact the most successful programming is exactly that. A fully indoctrinated North Korean who loves his dear leader may have felt absolutely no pressure his entire life because unless that pressure is highlighted as is the case with femininity, you don't notice it as pressure. You notice the feminine pressure because of how femininity has been vilified. At one point in time and in some cultures still, a woman would have never thought to wear pants and the idea of wearing them would have been as problematic to the woman as your idea of wearing a skirt. In much the same manner, a man wearing a skirt would have been rejected by women who liked their men to wear pants so a man would have been pressured to wear pants.

What you bring up is where I always start to get confused so I'd like your take. If you know men generally find you more attractive by looking and acting a certain way, wouldn't you want to do that because you also want to attract a man? Isn't ""who you are"" also someone who wants to attract a man as well as someone who wants to wear comfortable pants but you make a call to decide which is more relevant to you?

Think of it from the man's perspective. I know you know that I prefer you to look/act a certain way so if you don't do that then you've signaled that I'm not very important to you. You find comfortable pants more important than attracting me.

On the flip side, I know I would be willing to do whatever it takes to attract a woman I was interested in. If that means going to the gym everyday, learning how to play the guitar, earning lots of money and spending it on them, acting more masculine or maybe more feminine, then whatever. I want to do that because I want to attract women and I want women to do things that attract me. If that means I have to put in lots of effort into things that aren't necessarily me then so be it but I expect reciprocation. At the end of the day none of those things might be ""naturally"" who I am or ""naturally"" who you are but they are in fact ""naturally"" us because there's a natural desire to attract someone of the opposite sex so that is who you are. If every male peacock cut off their feathers and then announced their new form is more natural because they hated how uncomfortable those feathers were to carry around, is that really more natural? And why is no thought given to how that impacts the female peacocks? Oh sure, the female peacocks would be forced to just accept it because there's nothing they can do about it and male peacocks should be equal to females such that they can do what they want but is that truly desirable for both the female and the males? 

But I guess this could all tie in together with financial independence. Since women are now fully financially independent of men (for the most part) they don't have to do things to attract men now (where as before their survival depended on it) if they don't want to and many have chosen not to. What I don't fully comprehend is why? Because I know I am willing to do almost anything for women and not only that but I don't feel the pressure as negative so long as I get positive reinforcement from women for doing things they desire. And I'm fully independent financially, so why has independence for women turned out this way? Why is doing certain things to attract a partner an uncomfortable experience if you're getting positive reinforcement from your partner for the things you're doing? Shouldn't bringing them happiness bring you happiness?

Perhaps I'm just an old relic at 31yo though. I've always considered that maybe younger men just happen to like the new version of women as much as I like the old version. I grew up in a funny time where my first 15 years of my life was during a period where feminine qualities were still highly regarded and then the next 15 years saw a complete rejection of them for being oppressive. Unfortunately for me, it's the first 15 years of my life that ultimately shaped what I desire and now to change them would be almost like telling a gay guy to just like women. But at the same time, I still do think there's some natural biological aspect to it that our society is fighting against and perhaps there will be more of a (push-back) or reversion to the mean in another decade.",4844,testimonial injustice,thanks bring see way topic original comment like discussion anyway think feel pressure masculine quality quality highlight bad specific trait take note avoid pressure stream societal convention craft adopt trait path least resistance feel pressure accept need feel pressure pressure fact successful programming exactly fully indoctrinated north korean love dear leader may felt absolutely pressure entire life unless pressure highlight case femininity notice pressure notice feminine pressure femininity vilify one point time culture still woman would never think wear pant idea wear would problematic woman idea wear skirt much manner man wear skirt would reject woman like men wear pant man would pressure wear pant bring always start get confuse like take know men generally find attractive look act certain way want also want attract man also someone want attract man well someone want wear comfortable pant make call decide relevant think man perspective know know prefer look act certain way signal important find comfortable pant important attract flip side know would willing whatever take attract woman interested mean go gym everyday learn play guitar earn lot money spending act masculine maybe feminine whatever want want attract woman want woman thing attract mean put lot effort thing necessarily expect reciprocation end day none thing might naturally naturally fact naturally us natural desire attract someone opposite sex every male peacock cut feather announce new form natural hat uncomfortable feather carry around really natural think give impact female peacock oh sure female peacock would force accept nothing male peacock equal female want truly desirable female male guess could tie together financial independence since woman fully financially independent men part thing attract men survival depend want many choose fully comprehend know willing almost anything woman feel pressure negative long get positive reinforcement woman thing desire fully independent financially independence woman turn way certain thing attract partner uncomfortable experience get positive reinforcement partner thing bring happiness bring happiness perhaps old relic 31yo though always consider maybe young men happen like new version woman much like old version grow funny time first 15 year life period feminine quality still highly regarded next 15 year saw complete rejection oppressive unfortunately first 15 year life ultimately shaped desire change would almost like tell gay guy like woman time still think natural biological aspect society fight perhaps push back reversion mean another decade,"feel, like, manager, engineering, job",0.8055528218681202,"abuse, rejection, misuse, assessed, abusive",0.5199999999999996,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.4088989876289431

Here is my 2 cents about the gender pay gap from a senior management exec in an MNC (Engineering field)

When we talk about gender pay gap people usually compare different sector and industries. As a VP in an MNC want to talk about the pay structure of the individual in a similar professional settings. 

In all MNCs the women are making similar amount to the men starting out.

All employees regardless of their gender (when graduated from university) are offered exactly the same salary packages and benefits. The only difference is in terms of tiers which is affected by

* Their qualification (1st class, 2nd class etc, etc) someone with a first class can expect better tiers compared to someone with just a pass degree, and,
* Special cases for example, head hunted. Someone maybe showing great potential, exceptional grades and having skillsets that set them aside from other candidates.

And in the above 2 factors, *gender of the candidate are not taken into consideration*. When we offer tier one to a candidate, say, 70kPA, that is regardless of that individual’s gender. Think of it as flat rate if you will.

However, as both of them progress in their career most men eventually will make more than the women.

I am going to offer some reasons why this is so. Note this does not mean all, but a significant number of them fall into the categories that I am about to discuss below. And you will come to see why it will affect their wages ultimately creating this ""gap""

* **- Men simply work longer hours.** As a VP I saw for myself the differences in working hours between the genders, Statically speaking on average the men work about 10% -20% more. Obviously there is the outlier but that just skewed the statistic more. For example, I have 9 guys under me working up to 80 hours per week consistently. There are currently no woman in my department working that hours.
* **- The lesser hours meant the women are often not as experienced in the work as someone who worked longer hours.** This is just common sense. The more you spend working on something the better, faster you are at that something and can complete the job with more competency.
* **-The less experiences meant basically they are not as good and knowledgeable in their work than others.** And you can see it too. Usually the reports, presentation etc. by the more experienced are more detailed with more insights on for example, technical areas. They are simply of better quality. When questioned they are able to answer satisfactory in a timely manner.The one with less experience and work less on the job simply are outperformed by the others. In many instances their report cannot answer my questions and when asked they take longer to reply or gave answer which demonstrate clearly their lack of experience and knowledge.
* **- Company offers better opportunities to higher achievers in the work place.** Point 1–3 shows how working longer hours basically meant more experiences and an individual getting better at their work. When a worker gets better the company gives more opportunity to the one who prove themselves through their effort and hard work.As a VP who do you think I will consider when I have a higher position open? Or certain opportunities? The one that is reliable or the one is not around, less knowledgeable, put in less hours? I will obviously consider the better candidate and in most cases the one who spend more time and effort in the work place IS the better candidate.

With better opportunities and more responsibilities they are rewarded with better financial incentives.

* **- Change in responsibilities and less working time after marriage.** Most of my females subordinates after marriage, got pregnant and took on less responsibilities when they came back from child birth for various reason. (Child care leave, child sick leave etc etc) So not only do they not hold as much responsibilities they work even less hour. No company will pay an employee for working lesser and taking on less responsibilities.
* **- The males on the other hand seems to spend more time working and taking on more responsibilities.** Also certain responsibilities give addition benefits. For example, the company give allowances for on site inspection. And they are done exclusively by the males. Also in cases like sending staff overseas for training in specialized field or to learn certain technology. That is also done by mainly the male in the company. More skill-sets, more responsibilities = better pay.

In summary. Women started making the same as their male counterpart starting out. But over time women due to different choices ending up making less.

Their decisions have a compounding effect on an individual’s career as discussed above.

Those that do put in the effort? They are as financially successful as their male counterpart. I have 2 female managers under me who are as capable as any male and making similar compared to male in their position. They achieve that by putting in the same work as the other high achiever.

However, if you consider the level of responsibilities and working hours these women mentioned are not paid less than men. In fact, i would say job scope wise and responsibilities they get the better end of the deal.

In short many women are quote unquote “making less” because they do less, spend less time at work and have less responsibilities DUE TO THE CHOICES THEY MADE resulting in less experiences and less skills which, no doubt will result in lower salary.

Note that I am not talking about comparing different professions. I am talking about the industry that I am working as a VP in. Even comparing similar profession most women tend to make choices taking on lesser hours and less responsibilities. this of course hamper their earning potential.",5872,testimonial injustice,hi thank ama enjoy read comment 2 cent gender pay gap senior management exec mnc engineering field talk gender pay gap people usually compare different sector industry vp mnc want talk pay structure individual similar professional setting mncs woman make similar amount men start employee regardless gender graduate university offer exactly salary package benefit difference term tier affect qualification 1st class 2nd class etc etc someone first class expect good tier compare someone pas degree special case example head hunt someone maybe show great potential exceptional grade skillsets set aside candidate 2 factor gender candidate take consideration offer tier one candidate say 70kpa regardless individual gender think flat rate however progress career men eventually make woman go offer reason note mean significant number fall category discuss come see affect wage ultimately create gap men simply work long hour vp saw difference work hour gender statically speak average men work 10 20 obviously outlier skew statistic example 9 guy work 80 hour per week consistently currently woman department work hour less hour meant woman often experience work someone work long hour common sense spend work something good fast something complete job competency less experience meant basically good knowledgeable work others see usually report presentation etc experience detailed insight example technical area simply good quality question able answer satisfactory timely manner one less experience work less job simply outperform others many instance report answer question ask take long reply give answer demonstrate clearly lack experience knowledge company offer good opportunity high achiever work place point 1 3 show work long hour basically meant experience individual get good work worker get good company give opportunity one prove effort hard work vp think consider high position open certain opportunity one reliable one around less knowledgeable put less hour obviously consider good candidate case one spend time effort work place good candidate good opportunity responsibility reward good financial incentive change responsibility less working time marriage female subordinate marriage get pregnant take less responsibility come back child birth various reason child care leave child sick leave etc etc hold much responsibility work even less hour company pay employee work less take less responsibility male hand seem spend time work take responsibility also certain responsibility give addition benefit example company give allowance site inspection do exclusively male also case like send staff overseas train specialized field learn certain technology also do mainly male company skill set responsibility good pay summary woman start make male counterpart start time woman due different choice end make less decision compound effect individual career discuss put effort financially successful male counterpart 2 female manager capable male make similar compare male position achieve put work high achiever however consider level responsibility work hour woman mention pay less men fact would say job scope wise responsibility get good end deal short many woman quote unquote make less less spend less time work less responsibility due choice make result less experience less skill doubt result low salary note talk compare different profession talk industry work vp even compare similar profession woman tend make choice take less hour less responsibility course hamper earn potential,"feel, like, manager, engineering, job",0.8055528218681202,"inexperienced, bitterness, belittling, dismissing, ostracism",0.04,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.6232434129806819

That is certainly a fresh breathe of air compared to some who immediately jumped into insults the moment your point does not match theirs.

For instance I had someone PM ""F**k you!"" 
So i respond ""I am sure that you are a very attractive men/women but I am afraid that I will have to decline your offer as I am taken .Happily married to a beautiful wife with 2 kids.""
To which he/she respond with ""Yea right you incel Go die in a fire"". 

The level of our conversation are just so on another level as you can see. I feel so sad that a man of my position making the money I do get this kind of insult that I am thinking of buying that AP watch that i have been considering for sometime now to make myself feel better. But since that will be the 3rd luxury watch for myself this year I think my wife will not be happy about me spending that kind of money.

With regards to your experiences here is what I have to say. 

I started my engineering career as a junior level exec and personally I have been through what you are describing. I can tell you honestly you are not the only one or the only gender facing this.  And witnessed the same happened to my friends male or female.

Many people in any working environment or field neglect the power of working on their people skills or soft skills. 

And this is especially a difficult skill to developed since you are in an Engineering field. I can say with some certainty that people in this field are not those that you will ""party with"" as it takes certain character to enjoy doing Maths and solve complex problems. 

This trait is worse in the older generation, as many of them being ""old school"" are often set in their way. But we deal with them because they are effective, hardworking, and overall good worker. Though personally I do think they need to work on their people skills.

They tend to be direct with anyone male or female and tend to not hold back,  whether be it offering criticism or tell you how they think you are stupid and cannot perform.  They are ""straight forward"".

I can see how you will take it personally if you have been confronted by these type of people as you start working. 

My personal experience. I was a newbie engineer responsible for the setting up of a new machine where upon completion I was to passdown to another department who will proceed with the calibration and loading of software to said machine. 

After passing down, about half way through the day I received a call from the engineer in charge. The first word I heard was "" What the f**k were you doing are you retarded"" without specifying where the retardation is.  And for a while after that he specifically told my manager he refuses to work with me as I am incompetent. 

If you are interested I could share other numerous experience I had. Fun times. 

We eventually do get over our differences though and he trust me enough to show me professional respect. Well...  He has too. I'm the VP 

Working environment can be difficult to navigate since the cultural differences of school,  where you can expect to find many support,  and work,  where if you are unlucky you can expect shit to be thrown your way. Many people including me find it daunting. 

Having been through the America schooling system when I started my career I was shocked to find out what working life is actually like.  These seemingly rude,  crass,  uneducated people are actually my superior!??  

When taking my Masters the majority were so professional.  Now working many seems so unprofessional.  Unbecoming of someone who might consider themselves an engineer. 

If you don't have thick skin it can easily affect you.  Trust me when I say just because you don't see it doesn't mean they are not being obnoxious to the male staff too. 

About the part that you find your superior reholding information from you that is surprisingly rather common. They have something you don't.  Be it knowledge, or a skill,  or the ability to be more effective in their work. 

Some people think that keeping info or a skill set to themselves makes them more valuable and indispensable when retrenchment come.  Not to say it is right or wrong but it is what it is. 

They see no need to help you or give you the information for free. Seeing as you are just a work mate and not a friend. 

My advice to you is work on your people skills,  have thicker skin and grind if you want to stay in our field. 

I say this to people all the time.  When your colleague are being shitty to you, understand that they are being shitty not to target you.  But they are doing so for their personal advantage . You just happens to be in their way. You need a certain level of enlightenment to be able to understand what I am saying.

Don't take what they say personally,  though I will admit that is easier said than done. Learn to focus on the point rather than the tone of the delivery and do what you need to do. This is what you need to get higher in the field,  which I find many youngster lack. 

This is a problem because people who are usually very good at their work and can teach you a lot don't like to beat around the Bush and take nonsense from anyone. They tell it as it is. Many young people are simply not thick skin enough to benefit from these ""experts""

Someone in my position is actually taking the time to tell the things as it is,  no political correctness and people are triggered because of my tone or whatever. 

Just look at reddit where the majority users seems to be of the younger generation.  Anything triggers them,  anything is micro aggression 😂. Must be a racist,  sexist,  or whatever ist because blah blah blah. 

It's hilarious to me honestly. I like reddit especially because it's so easy to trigger them. Just look at my post histories. Instead of attacking my points they goes straight to personal attacks. And nothing they said gets to me because simply of my status. What is better than to trigger people when you are having a stressful day at work? For me, it's almost priceless. Something you cannot buy with money.

But back to our topic at hand since you are in an engineering field you can make a decent living being what we senior management call a ""farmer""- you do the same thing day in day out and get the predictable compensation for your work.

The visible form of sexism that men can observe is someone in power who actively holds disparaging feelings and ill-will toward women.

Based on my experience, technical people tend not to trust other peoples debugging. And I'm willing to admit that I'm no different.

(Trigger warning: broad generalization, but true for many) I think it's just a matter of women not being used to the harsh realities of work. They were pampered growing up and when thrown into the harsh world then they suddenly are shocked. Men were not pampered and were prepared for the harsh realities of having to work hard and put up with people's shit. So we half expect it, except the weak men who also complain all of the time about these same things. 

But then strong women also climb to the top and become very successful. It's willpower. You think men don't get talked down to at work? That's just false.

Unless you're lucky to have a good boss and a good atmosphere, but that is not the norm for most people, it isn't a gender or race issue.

I would, however, argue that we (humans - all of us), typically hear what we expect to hear, so our expectations of reality inevitably end up shaping our world views.

I simply stated that the examples given by OP are not sexism, because without context, they simply aren’t.  Even if she’s the only woman on her team and thinks that she’s the only person that experienced this sort of bias, that’s still not proof of sexism - she could be the ‘outsider’ for any number of reasons.  Just look at he examples of ‘sexism’ in the OP and then compare each one to your definition given.  Which one of those is clearly sexism?

More to the point, convincing yourself that the issues you experience are because of X is not helpful unless X is the truth.  If I am convinced that every time someone is an ass to me at work, that it is purely because of my age or race, then where does that get *me*?  It turns me into a bitter person who is incapable of improving my own situation, other than appealing to other people to help me out of the hole that I believe I am in as a result of my perceived disadvantage.

As stated in my comment, the best path forward is to use that ‘disadvantage’ as an advantage where it counts.

Now the serious part, this has hints of the typical IT ego, where people like to talk over one another because their ""knowledge"" (read: opinion) is better than yours regardless of sex.  I'm also sensing a bit of the surprise might be related to the number of rejects that manage to stick around in IT hanging under the radar, which causes low expectations. I have experienced the surprise from accomplishing simple tasks, like scripting out upgrades/changes/audits and whatnot.  I view these as simple but most people in the sysadmin world skate by without running more than ping and nslookup for most of their careers.  Don't even get me started on the people who say ""the linux"" ugh. 

All of the above seems to be wrapped up in a big ball of sexism, which is seriously fucked up. Luckily, more and more females are joining our career paths so it will get better in time, hang in there!

I will use the opportunity to share my partner's experience, though. That wasn't really a case of the technical team, but of the wider business, in a couple of forms:

1. The ""Can you put me on to..""s. When someone calls through to your department and requests to be put on to one of the developers. More irritation points when they persist in wanting to speak to someone else after being told that you are a dev.

2. The ""Bobs"". Name taken from office space. This would usually happen when someone was being introduced to the team (new higher-ups, or other new starters). They go around the team, introducing the developers, and when they get to you, the response is ""So, what do you *do* here?"". Bonus irritation points for ""Beauty and the Beast""ing it [(""It's a *girl* in the dev team!"")](https://youtu.be/mwtVunBOJzk?t=10).

The big difference between her situation and yours seems to be the team reaction. When she got the ""So, what do you *do* here?"", most of the rest of her team would say something to the effect of ""The same as us, only better"".

I've had all of the same issues you've had, and I'm a guy. You have to learn how not to be ignored and talked over. You have to assert yourself. You have to not let people you know are incompetent ""help"" you.

EDIT: In response to OPs edit. I'm not presuming to know exactly what you're going through, I can only understand from what you're describing, and what you're describing is exactly what everyone else goes through as well. Workplaces are competitive, and you have to ""play the game"" to a point or you're going to get walked on. I looked at that study and it just collated responses. I'm wondering how much of this supposed sexism is actually sexism as opposed to the same things everyone goes through however women perceive it as sexism instead? The difference between perceived sexism in STEM and non-STEM fields was just 9%, so I doubt a career change would make you any happier.

I can say with absolute certainty that the vast majority of men do not care if you are male or female, in STEM fields, and IT in particular, we just want to get the work done and not have someone who isn't pulling their own weight. There is no cabal of men actively keeping women out. I am not saying sexism doesn't exist, however I think it is greatly overblown and probably has more to do with how men and women approach work.

Also, do not take advice as being ""mansplained"" to. We do not want you to leave the field you love, we are trying to help keep you in it.

But some of this is normal sysadmin stuff regardless of gender. A lot of sys admins are condescending know-it-alls with poor people skills, that is an unfortunate but often true stereotype. Better ones rise to the top, but they hire us (or similar roles) for the technical knowledge we have, not because we are great communicators.

And this needs to be changed. It's not OK to be an asshat to anyone. I'm not suggesting you're saying it's OK incidentally, but you do seem to be saying ""That's just the way it is...""

Bad behaviour needs to be an issue that gets fixed, not something that gets brushed off as ""that's just the way IT people are"". It hurts us as a community. It hurts our professional standing in business, where people see IT as somewhere between ""unprofessional"" and a liability. It raises entry barriers to minorities (whether gender or race). 

I remember when I was a junior mainframe operator back in the day I was teased (well these days they'd probably call it bullying but I was robust enough to not take it to heart) because I was painfully shy when it came to matters of dating and women, and really didn't want to join in the banter on my shift. 

I frequently had pictures of naked women from pornographic magazines thrust under my nose in front of the whole team, with people barking at me to locate the pictured woman's clitoris and laughing and accusing me of being gay and/or a virgin when I refused to participate.

So those people would probably regard that as ""banter"". Other than being embarrassed at the time, I wasn't too bothered myself... but there were one or two women on the team and one or two guys who subsequently came out as gay, and someone here please try and tell me that seeing all this stuff happen didn't make those individuals feel like crap.

One of them actually looks like an anime character come to life, and she has crawled through the depths of chauvinism hell to get to where she is.

But in every new interaction, folks think she's either the artist or someone's girlfriend. [sigh] 

I have no advice on how to ""fix"" it - we're all working on it, but it's going to take forever. My advice to you is:

- Don't let the bastards get you down. Just because someone treats you like crap, try not to let it color your world. 
- Not everyone is like that. If you are in a hostile work environment where it feels like the atmosphere itself is ""she's a frail girl"" then start looking for another job
- Chauvinism is a spectrum, so try to measure your contempt somewhat. Many of us troglodytes were raised in an age where we were brainwashed into this shit, and it's not easy to shake. So if an otherwise nice guy lets slip some random comment that you find offensive, but is harmless in the big picture, consider cutting him a bit of slack. Or take him aside and just explain it to him gently. Use small words - we're kind of slow. 
- Not all stupidity is because you're female. While I know that you catch a lot of shit for not having a Y chromosome, some of the things you describe are bullshit that we all have to put up with. (The ""when I'm on step 10, someone tries to 'help' me with step 1"" in particular is something I fight all the time, and probably looks familiar to most sysadmins). I guess my suggestion here is to try to mentally filter: ""do I know he's treating me like a child because I have breasts? If not, then presume he's treating me like a child because he's just a general asshole and react appropriately.""

MORE THAN ANYTHING - always remember to accept advice as just that. In no way, shape, or form am I suggesting there is no sexism in IT - it's fucking rampant, and embarrassing.

It's because this line of thought is super common and honestly hurtful to people. This line of reasoning keeps women out of the IT field, period. It makes people like OP quit jobs. And that makes me angry.

Words and phrases do have meaning, and they can be hurtful, sometimes incredibly hurtful, even if not intending to be. Not seeing that truth, to me, is willful ignorance.

Furthermore, a phrase like 'it must be your time of the month' is so clearly based in a sexist attitude that to just write it off is, again, willful ignorance, and it does matter. ""Words have no meaning beyond what you give them"" - this is true. ""You should attempt to understand the spirit of the words"" - this is fair, as long as the speaker is willing to understand the spirit of the words. For instance, that 'it being that time of the month' is clearly, clearly, clearly about shaming women for something they can't control, and also belittling them. Why should only the listener have be willing to understand the spirit of the words - why not the speaker? Of course, when a man tells you this you both feel that women get irrational during their periods or during the lead up to their periods, and that's the joke. He's not just saying, 'you're acting irrational,' he's also saying, 'you're acting irrational like a woman acts irrational due to her period.' even if the intent is the former interpretation, you literally cannot understand the phrase without inherently understanding the latter meaning. And that's sexist, sir.

I believe that it's a difficult proposition to ask that a woman who walks into a workplace where sexist words and phrases and jokes are used commonly really figure out the ""true intent"" behind these things. They're hostile things, they make her feel like shit, they make her feel less respected because she's seen them be used as a weapon all her life, but you suggest she take time out of her life to give all these phrases and jokes and shit a real studying to see if they're intended to be hurtful or not?

Personally I think that the sad truth is that racism will always exist.  It is a conclusion a white male can come to quite easily, as they've never been on the receiving end, but much tougher for other people who have felt the burden weighing upon their shoulders for generations.

We just need to keep pushing the stigma that these types of people have no place in a regular society.  Don't lock them up.  Don't let them lead our country (lol).  Help them.  Let them say what they want, but stress that it will not be tolerated in professional or social settings.  They'll get fired, excommunicated, what have you.  But some may learn to understand why what they say has an impact on people.  And to those that never will stop...simply ignoring and turning the other cheek is seriously the best defense we can have.  Because in this climate they are on the rise specifically because people are wanting to crackdown and make hate speech banned or illegal in all settings.

And lastly, I want to stress that so many of these people are simply misguided.  I grew up in a strong conservative household.  I used words in a derogatory nature growing up in school, as it was what my role models had done and I didn't know better.  I've since realized and have been doing my best to make amends.  And if it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone in a similar situation.

The problem is, right now these people are being ousted from society completely.  There is no redemption for them.  There is only one group of people willing to accept them for who they have been cast as.

I have ""issues"" because I'm watching the upvotes on this entire thread from the OP go down. Repeatedly. I saw it when it was originally up around the 1800's. We're now at 1563 and going down.

I have ""issues"" I'm watching as she's repeatedly told that it's all in her head. That's it's not the industry, it's just her company, despite hundreds and thousands of women speaking out saying that they experience the same thing.(https://twitter.com/girlgerms/status/1007338988309319680)

I have ""issues"" because women like you tell us that speaking out does nothing and hurts our cause, even though doing nothing just makes the problem worse.

I have ""issues"" because men seem to think that us speaking up about this is being ""hostile"" and that we're attacking them for this, even though they're the same people who've seen this happening and have been oblivious to it or have turned a blind eye because ""boys will be boys"".

I have ""issues"" because I'm sick and tired of having to fight for my right to exist in this industry without having to prove myself every time I meet someone new.

I have ""issues"" because I'm angry at being mistaken as someone's girlfriend, or a 'booth babe', or event staff at a technical conference, even when my name badge says ""SPEAKER"".

I have ""issues"" when women in this industry are told to keep their mouths shut because it'll make their company look bad if they speak out - not the behaviour they've experienced. 

I have ""issues"" when women are moved teams and shifted into something they don't want to be doing to get away from men who have behaved inappropriately towards them, while those same get to stay in their team with no repercussions.

I'd also like to say that telling someone they need therapy in a derogatory way is insanely insulting, especially to people who are in therapy. I know a large proportion of people in this industry have some form of mental health issue and you denigrating that makes it less likely that someone seeing this would seek help for fear of it being held against them, that there's something ""wrong"" with them.

I'm one of those women who started out on IBM mainframes. I've been doing this for a long, long time. I love every minute of it. 

These days, I'm mostly the HBIC. I don't get much of this stuff anymore, but I've had some rough times. What I've learned comes down to one simple thing: attitude. 

Your desk/workstation/office/cubicle is your kingdom. You don't let *anyone* who isn't your boss come into your kingdom and take over. If someone comes over to ""help"" or ""correct you"" or ""explain things"" to you, push them out. Say, ""That's very interesting. Send me an email, okay?"" If they grab your keyboard or your laptop to ""show you,"" reach over and take it back. ""Sorry, I'm on deadline. Send me an email, okay?"" If they tell you you are wrong, essentially say ""prove it""--in a nicer way, of course. If you get the absolute asshole who won't back off, you grab some papers, stand up, tell him you don't have time right now, and walk out. Bonus points if you can step on his foot or kick his leg on your way out. 

I don't give a single fuck what people say about me behind my back. If they want to call me bossy and opinionated, I don't care. I only care that I do my job and do it well. 

If I get comments to my face about time of the month, or hormones, or ...anything related to gender..., I put on my resting bitch face and say, ""I have balls bigger than yours...in a jar on my desk."" Because really, those guys are insecure little boys.

And here's the other thing: if anyone tries to screw up my work or make me look bad to my boss, I will seriously fuck them up. It may take me a while, but I'm smarter than they are. They will never see me coming. Know how I know this? Because smart, serious people don't waste their time trying to make other people look bad. Only idiots do that. 

Ninety-five percent of the people you work with will be just fine. They will be more than just fine. They will collaborate, and teach, and help you be a smarter, more skilled worker.  

The other 5% you just have to handle. But you have to remember that they are all guys and guys spend way too much time trying to be the alpha in the room. You don't need to try. You are a woman.

So yes, it was intended as a derogatory term, but only to the people making other people's lives worse.

Yes, but by using a gendered slur like that, especially to refer to a behavior that is completely understandable in today's society, you take a really aggressive, antagonistic, and downright offensive stance. You even **meant** it to be!

You are:

1. Removing the onus on women and men who aren't worried ""tech bro"" might not apply to them because of their fashion choices to re-examine their behavior.

2. Attacking *literally every man who has a tech job*. Just because you think the word only applies to an undefined subset that you've defined and decided are bad, doesn't mean that something that can only be applied to one gender identity doesn't affect everyone who belongs to the gender you've chosen to disparage. How do you think women would feel if we started popularizing ""tech ho"" to describe *just a subset* of women in tech that we don't like for some superficial reason, even if it doesn't apply to them? The fact is, the only things that are really consistent with every possible interpretation of a ""tech bro"" is that he's a man that works in tech, and he's *bad*.

3. Completely missing the point of the comment. Now, since only ""tech bros"" mistake sexism and misogyny, anyone who behaves in a sexist manner can simply say ""well, I'm not a tech bro (you know, one of *those* dudes), so I must not be sexist."" Yet another way you've made it harder to educate people on the issue.

4. Giving fuel to every MRA/Anti-feminist/MGTOW/Red-piller who can now talk about how much feminists hate men and the world is totally out to get them. This is the most egregious one, and honestly the reason I got so angry with your comment.

Honestly, if this were in any other thread, I wouldn't have responded as harshly, but here, where we're trying to be thoughtful about sex and gender in society, to have someone who can both seem to get and completely disregard the point, means I can only assume that you came at it from a bad place.

There's more stuff to learn and go through the motions of the sysadmin. Everyone i know has been through that kind of testing while starting out. 

Anyone either guys or girls who complained and brought other issues like he doesn't like me that's why he pushed me out of this project, he did this because i am too white etc etc. I just lost respect for them. Maybe there are cases and trust me in this day and age, one accusation by a girl is enough to destroy a guy's career, hell a whole company. So in that regard when people still talk that they face these regularly i lose respect for them because they just couldn't handle the work or the hardwork needed to suceed in it, so instead of accepting they are not good enough they resort to stuff like this. 

Sonyeah the sexism term has been abused for the past 2 years and it is an out for women who can't work as hard. So whenever a girl says sexism i always have doubt because i have seen cases supporting the not good enough theory than their imagination.

As for your comment about people caring about people's feelings is more intelligence then I don't even know what to reply to that kind of ignorant comment. 

I mean by that logic, all the companies have less intelligence and everyone should just stop having a fiscal analysis and have a social analysis on people's feelings.

Look at this thread. Do you think a guy saying i dont get enough respect at my job would get 3 gilds and so many supporting comments. Guy would just get dude, i respect you and chamge your job. Because this is not something most guys are doing for fun or as a second income where parents are fine wealthily so even if you fail. Nothing happens. These guys have to live, their month is dependant on the work they do. They dont have time to type in this sexism or my boss is rude shit.


Its also because no one takes it seriously in the sense every guy *gets* it and replies fuck him and do in another place. Because that's the fastest and cheapest option than having a pity parade where he wont even get any support and money etc because there are no movements. It's just how it is. Maybe if we had so much money movements snd social movements, males would do it more who knows but i can tell you this, there are less males even in those too as males *have* to get a job to be considered respectful whereas it's not the same for a women.

Is that someone you work with regularly (as in ""they should know you know your shit"") or some random people you barely know ?.

In second case ""assume incompetence"" is not unreasonable reaction (because honestly there is a *lot* of people that know how to follow a manual and not much else above it)

In first, after ""one too many"" I just assume they're the type that needs a stick more than they need a carrot and say something along the way ""yes, of course, that's the first thing I did an HOUR ago, go away, you're not helping"" or (if I asked them something about it and they try to go back from start) ""If you don't know the answer, say it instead of guessing what is happening"". Well, I'm more rude than that but the point is being nice not always works and sometimes you need to stand your ground and call out someone for their bullshit.

> Today I was told I was wrong and the easily verifiable issue I was working on didn't exist, until I provided screen shots as proof.

I usually just go by ""why"" method and ask them for their reasoning that got them to their conclusion. Usually about one or two ""but why you think that is the case/is why that happened"" or ""interesting, could you show me where it said it does that"" they get to a moment when only reason  is ""because I thought so"" or ""because it is bad"". And occasionally they mention something I didn't even thought about and both sides win.

On other side I do ask for as much debug info from user as possible (""here, you can tcpdump it like that and send me result"" and such. Thankfully I work with developers mostly) and some problems *are* just unbelievably weird at first glance so I wouldn't be bothered by it that much.

I agree with the others that the employer has a huge relevance here as management should come down hard on this type of treatment. I do not think this will change without the pioneers to show other women that this type of career can be fun. Throughout the years my employers have actively sought women but don't receive the candidates. When I talk to the women in my life they pro\-port zero interest, however I can't help but feel that they are afraid of the type of environment you describe. The only way the ""male"" culture stereotype of I.T. will get busted is by showing a growing majority of women participants. 

I relate to some of the statements you made. This career type attracts people that focus on things in such a direct way that they can't see the big picture very well. Autistic tendency is a joke on forums but I know personally many I.T. workers who fall into this category. Unfortunately the deeper into this spectrum you are the more difficult it is to be empathetic and realize how what you are saying or doing is affecting others. In no way do I want to take away from your experiences here as a woman as those comments you report are disgustingly inappropriate. I do want to mention that some of what you discuss is just plain offensive to another human regardless of gender and is commonplace in this field. 

Just because you think someone is wrong does not mean you get to dismiss them. You should always treat a person with respect and when mistakes are made find where they contributed or helped. This is not common and even in this sub\-reddit it's a common theme of berating incompetence and heralding ""doing things the proper way"". This black and white mentality is caustic and leads to the inundating stress that causes people to give up the field or as we've seen in previous posts even as far as to take their life. 

This is a generalization and therefore inaccurate in some cases. I still find that male culture especially in the workplace suffers from a lack of openness. Males typically express how their co\-workers make them feel. Males typically avoid showing weakness and so hurtful banter is commonplace. This lack of feedback means the caustic behavior can manifest without threat for years. I think that has been extended to you and this is where your voice can improve the lives for men and women alike. My point here too is that you are a unique and capable individual. You are not only a token woman braving the obstacle of sexism. Your analysis, your opinions, your solutions are valuable to the rest of us out here. We want you, We need you! on our side to do the kind of thinking and acting that evolve the field in a healthy way. 

I implore you to keep going. Look for your like minded peers. The kind ones, the polite ones, the re\-enforcing ones. Ditch a company that doesn't cultivate an environment that attracts these people. The future men and women of this career need you to lead the way.

Okay, in a perfect world, you wouldn't need to say shit. The guys would be respectful or else other guys would call them out on their behavior. Totally agreed. However, when the world refuses to be perfect, it's time to whack it with a sledgehammer.

As in any group dynamic, you'll need to read the room to figure out the best way to approach this, but the HR directive of ""work it out with the employee(s) you have issue with before escalating to management"" is a good default. How you approach this can depend on your own temperament and the temperament of the employee you're working your situation, but a polite example might be, ""Fucknuts (or whatever their name is), I respect your experience and the time you take to assist me, but you're doing some things that I find disrespectful/patronizing/etc."" You can lay this out. They may get the message or they may not, but say what you have to say and make it clear to them that this bothers you, and get them to acknowledge this.

You want to have these conversations one-on-one. Don't put yourself in a situation where a number of people gang up on you to tell you that you're wrong.

A warning: People that constantly talk over other people, in my experience, will (hilariously enough) talk over you to defend themselves. If you get them to shut up long enough, they will not actually listen, they will instead wait for their chance to defend themselves, AND YOU WILL NEED TO POINT THIS OUT TO THEM. They will get defensive. They will say they don't do X even as they're currently doing it. They will be mad at you for disparaging their character even if they don't say anything. This will be an unpleasant conversation, because they will rarely admit to being wrong. You're not going to make friends here is what I'm saying, but that's not the goal. The goal is to establish that you're not pavement to be driven over, and you NEED to establish that or you're never going to be happy where you're working at. Rip the band-aid off, you'll be better in the long run.

Finally: After you have all the conversations you need to have, you need to: 1) reinforce it (""Remember that thing we talked about? You're doing it again."") and 2) document it. Keep a log. Yes, this sucks (we'll get to that.) If people don't get the message, it's time to escalate. Talk to your manager. If that doesn't resolve anything, talk to HR. Don't give up. Don't think it's going to be different somewhere else, because honestly, it probably won't. In the immortal words of the poet Drake, the grass is green where you water it.

Now, does all this suck? HELL YES. Should women have to go through all this shit just to be treated equally? ABSOLUTELY NOT. It sucks balls. I hate that women are being turned off from my industry because men can't get their shit together.

And I hate to say this, but I'm no exception. For a long time I was always vociferously protective of my female charges in IT. I didn't let them fight their own battles, which was not only patronizing but counterproductive in that I cut them off from defending themselves when the shit flew. One of them spoke up to me about it. I heard, but didn't listen. The next time I was in a conference call defending her, she loudly told me, in front of everyone, that she could speak for herself.

This is why when you run a game from Steam it may download a very specific version of DirectX, but that doesn't guarantee the game runs the exact same way.

Not having the hardware differ and having all the drivers written by one company -- Apple or Google, or whoever made the hardware -- means there are no or few bugs due to driver differences. The ""drivers"" may only update when you update your phone.

Adding, as others have said, that this really remains the leading cause of crashes in Windows and most games.

To start, the drivers are the smattering of dlls provided by AMD or NVIDIA. Also, your computer really talks to different devices by electrical signals. I won't go there but it helps to keep in mind. When a game issues a ""draw call"" to your video card, it first issues it to Direct3D/Vulkan/etc., which then talks to the video card driver, which then issues the specific correct commands to the card.

There are layers. Game -> Direct3D/Vulkan -> Driver -> electrons. Vaguely. The bridge between driver and electrons is a piece of x86 architecture called DMA. In short: your CPU writes to a specific portion of memory that's mapped -- copied -- to a specific piece of hardware. That's how they really communicate.

Your video card exposes commands to your CPU. The specific chip on that video card exposes different commands. NVIDIA's 2060 and 1060 supply different commands. In short, each new video card is *generally* as different as a PS3 is to a Switch. It's kind of like a dictionary to various spoken languages. The 1060 and 1060 Ti are like different dialects of English (British vs American). The 1060 and AMD's RX580 are like going to the friendly Korea and speaking some extinct Native American language.

Drivers don't bridge that gap. I was lying with this short sentence that looked like it might be super informative.

Drivers make that gap easier to cross. I don't know all the damned commands supplied by AMD's RX580 at the hardware level and I don't have to. Those dlls often come with documentation that describes what's in there. But, you don't actually get to make a game against those lower-level dlls. You make a game against Direct3D/Vulkan/etc.

DirectX, Vulkan and Open GL *do* bridge that gap. NVIDIA and AMD have to supply a dll that implements all of the DirectX functionality.

One very basic ""draw call"" is simply ""bitch, clear the screen"". That function is called something like ""ClearScreen"" in one of those driver dlls. But you call the specific commands in Direct3D/Vulkan, which you now know is really a dll supplied by AMD or NVIDIA that implements the specific commands laid out by Microsoft/Khronos Group. Because the Direct3D/Vulkan driver ""interface"" (what commands it supplies and what they do) is (supposed to be) standard across all video card, a game can now issue a series of commands to whatever your card is and it (should) work the same.

Filling in the gap: drivers used to be simple and they haven't been for a long time. Now they manipulate the game's commands to help along that specific video card. Maybe a series of commands in a specific order works slow but if you change the order, it runs faster. The driver may collect a string of commands before executing them and re-order them without the game knowing. If this holding and re-ordering changes the behavior of something else *just too much* that the game expects, *crash*. And maybe Radeon VII needs this change but the RX580 doesn't, so the game crashes on just that card.",3032,testimonial injustice,really explanation anyway start driver smatter dlls provide amd nvidia also computer really talk different device electrical signal go help keep mind game issue draw call video card first issue direct3d vulkan etc talk video card driver issue specific correct command card layer game direct3d vulkan driver electron vaguely bridge driver electron piece x86 architecture call dma short cpu write specific portion memory map copy specific piece hardware really communicate video card expose command cpu specific chip video card expose different command nvidia 2060 1060 supply different command short new video card generally different ps3 switch kind like dictionary various speak language 1060 1060 ti like different dialect english british v american 1060 amd rx580 like go friendly korea speaking extinct native american language driver bridge gap lie short sentence look like might super informative driver make gap easy cross know damn command supply amd rx580 hardware level dlls often come documentation describes actually get make game low level dlls make game direct3d vulkan etc directx vulkan open gl bridge gap nvidia amd supply dll implement directx functionality one basic draw call simply bitch clear screen function call something like clearscreen one driver dlls call specific command direct3d vulkan know really dll supply amd nvidia implement specific command laid microsoft khronos group direct3d vulkan driver interface command supply suppose standard across video card game issue series command whatever card work fill gap driver use simple long time manipulate game command help along specific video card maybe series command specific order work slow change order run fast driver may collect string command execute order without game know hold order change behavior something else much game expect crash maybe radeon vii need change rx580 game crash card,"work, job, leave, code, rude",0.781050670582822,"manipulate, isolation, reprimand, discounting, inexperienced",0.5199999999999996,"stare, require, rectify, image, carmen",0.28101628957155883

Modern operating systems make PCs a lot less vulnerable, but there are still plenty of ways to get burned.

### OS Design

Older PCs tended to let the computer have full control of the machine. So if a user could be talked into running a virus, that virus could do anything it wanted.

Newer PCs adopt a model that tries to limit what any one program can do to the system. In some cases, a program simply isn't allowed to do certain things unless the user has jumped through a lot of hoops. This was always true on *some* ""older"" operating systems like Unix, on which Linux, Mac OS, iOS, and Android are based. On Windows, this didn't start happening until Vista, and users immediately wanted ways to turn it off. 

On iOS, Apple is the only entity allowed to operate as a user with full control. You may root your phone to gain this power, but it voids your warranty. Android generally has this approach too, but some manufacturers make it easier to root your phone. If either of the phones are rooted, they are more vulnerable to a virus than they would be otherwise. This is related to the next part.

### Application Deployment

On old PCs, you didn't worry much about installing software. You put executable code on a disk and ran it. So all a virus had to do was talk a user into that.

In the Unix-style model, not every user is able to execute code if it isn't in certain places, and only special users can put executable code there. So a virus has to talk a user into talking someone else into installing it, which generally doesn't work. This is what Windows was doing with the UAC dialog everyone hated. ""Hey, something's trying to install software. Did you expect this?""

Regardless, if the person who *can* install software installs a virus, it passes the first hurdle and can start doing bad things.

App stores help combat this. On iOS, you can't install software at all unless it comes through the Apple App Store. That (presumably) means they have tested it to make sure it won't break your phone. There are some ways to install things without it (Facebook was exploiting one recently), but they are meant to help programmers debug thing and *still* require something called a ""digital certificate"" that tells you who to blame if it's a virus.

Android can be configured to only trust the Google Play store, but generally it's easier to install random programs on an Android phone. Thus, Android sees more malware and viruses than iOS because it's easier to trick a person who doesn't understand the implications into disabling their security blanket. 

Both OSX and Windows 10 also have app stores with similar status. Apple and Microsoft promise they've inspected the software within these stores to make sure it isn't malicious. The stores are also set up in such a way that if they make a mistake, they can block the software from running.

### Overall

So really the problem is perception. 

People were really used to Windows machines letting them have free reign, but that was really dangerous and made it easy for viruses to spread. When Microsoft started doing the right thing to combat it, people hated it and demanded that Microsoft let them go back to the dangerous way. And even when everything's on, it only takes one dumb ""Yes"" to install a virus.

iOS and Android released in a state that was more locked down. Since people didn't have a long history of ""wide open"" phones to compare them to, they didn't demand total access. Because the way you install programs is more locked down, and the impact any one program can have is significantly limited, these devices seem a lot safer.

But if you don't disable all the ""naggy"" features on Mac OS or Windows 10, and you only install software from their respective app stores, you get the same kind of safety.",3853,testimonial injustice,o design software instal modern operate system make pcs lot less vulnerable still plenty way get burn os design old pc tend let computer full control machine user could talk run virus virus could anything want new pc adopt model try limit one program system case program simply allow certain thing unless user jump lot hoop always true old operate system like unix linux mac os io android base window start happen vista user immediately want way turn ios apple entity allow operate user full control may root phone gain power void warranty android generally approach manufacturer make easy root phone either phone root vulnerable virus would otherwise relate next part application deployment old pc worry much instal software put executable code disk run virus talk user unix style model every user able execute code certain place special user put executable code virus talk user talk someone else instal generally work window uac dialog everyone hat hey something try install software expect regardless person install software installs virus pass first hurdle start bad thing app store help combat io install software unless come apple app store presumably mean tested make sure break phone way install thing without facebook exploit one recently mean help programmer debug thing still require something call digital certificate tell blame virus android configure trust google play store generally easy install random program android phone thus android see malware virus io easy trick person understand implication disable security blanket osx windows 10 also app store similar status apple microsoft promise inspect software within store make sure malicious store also set way make mistake block software run overall really problem perception people really used window machine let free reign really dangerous make easy virus spread microsoft start right thing combat people hat demanded microsoft let go back dangerous way even everything take one dumb yes install virus io android release state lock since people long history wide open phone compare demand total access way install program lock impact one program significantly limit device seem lot safer disable naggy feature mac os window 10 install software respective app store get kind safety,"work, job, leave, code, rude",0.781050670582822,"inexperienced, bitterness, belittling, dismissing, ostracism",0.04,"privacy, degrade, phone, require, feminine",0.38837534318134415

When several good employees complain about a single jerk, why not come down hard on the jerk?

Because corporations, which are usually abusive in nature, give more value to managers/supervisors that also exhibit abusive personality traits. Why? Because toxic leaders are more likely to do whatever necessary to carry out a company's goals, including things that are illegal, immoral, and harmful to others. 

There was a new study just published on the subject, that showed that companies do tend to show a preference in hiring bosses with ""dark personality traits,""  because such people are typically more willing to engage in unethical and illegal activities on behalf of the company. So, basically, toxic managers are perceived as being better for the corporate bottom-line, which makes protecting their employment a bigger priority than protecting the victims of their abuse. Isn't capitalism swell? :-)

When I tried it many years ago, the way it worked was you were to progress through ten speeches, each time focusing on one kind or aspect of making a speech. 


I enjoyed making my first few speeches because there was a supporting group of people to listen to it.  It was a great way to build  confidence.


 I think every person has a charm of his or her  own and this is a great way for someone to discover the things other people find adorable about that person. I discovered, for example, that my quiet soft voice was perfect for microphones and that my shy empathic nature made me a good reader of the mood in a room and so I could easily make appropriate, sometimes funny, remarks on the fly! Both big, delightful surprises for me.


In Toastmasters someone counts the number of times the speaker says ""um"" and ""ah"" during each speech. It only took about 3 speeches before I stopped using those useless filler words. I carry this lesson with me throughout life and it contributes to my ability to present myself well in daily encounters with important people.

I haaated public speaking when it was in the context of giving presentations at school, but in my adult life, it's no stress at all, for many of the reasons you list. 

When speaking professionally, I know my stuff. I am there because I know things they do not, and they want to learn. As others have said, if anyone ever asks a question about my material that I don't know, they aren't doing it to ""gotcha"" me. I can just say ""I don't know but I'll look into it and get back to you"" and that is fine. 

When speaking personally, remember that folks are rooting for your success. I officiate weddings as a side gig, and at a recent wedding a parent came up to me and was like ""oh my god you must be so nervous! I could never do what you do!"" I was not nervous at all, I explained. I don't really know the majority of the audience, and will probably never see them again after that day. Plus, they want me to succeed. They want it to be a beautiful,meaningful wedding. 

Same thing when I had to give a toast at a friend's wedding. People WANT to like the toast. Keep it short, don't do anything obviously offensive, and you're good. 

In both personal and professional contexts, I find that formal preparation tends to do more harm than good, for me.

They focus on all the positive things, minimize the negatives and teach you how to prepare for your presentation, help you in how to present it, etc. I had been in the professional world for years and always felt like I was just spinning my wheels, invisible, and unable to adequately speak my piece anywhere. To make a long story short, after this course everything changed. What used to be stressful situations became opportunities. My eye opened was when I was asked to talk to my work group about the course and my experience with it. We were in a conference room when I was asked to present with no time to prepare. Previously I would have freaked out and stumbled my way through some miserable facts, boring everyone along the way. What happened was far from that. I was able to tell my tale, walking from side to side in the room, looking people in the eye, seeing them react to various things I was saying, and noting who reacted to what, all the while never missing a beat in what I was saying. Warn I was done and sat down, I felt so much pride I could barely listen to anyone else speak. This was so far from where I had been that the difference was nearly unimaginable to me. I can still speak at the drop of a hat with confidence. A good example of another graduate of this course is Lee Iaccoa. After taking this course, you couldn't keep that man away from a microphone. The results were amazing for me and several others in my work area took the course as well, all with similar results.

I did a lot of musical theater/orchestra/vocal performance growing up, so I had been exposed enough to those feelings of nervousness by the time I got to middle school. 

For people that don't have a background in performance, the biggest hurdle to overcome is the fear of embarrassing one's self in front of a large crowd of people. I think people really underestimate each other's sense of empathy when it comes to public speakers and performers. Public speaking is something that most people fear, so it's very doubtful that a crowd will be unsympathetic to a person who fumbles on their words or appears nervous. This of course is just one person's opinion, and doesn't always apply to professional speakers or performers. 

My public speaking process is to research the hell out of what I'm talking about. In addition to front-end research, I like to take a step back and imagine what parts of my speech the audience might be the most curious or confused about. Those are the places I either add the most detail, or absorb the information in case there's a Q&A. As a writer, I always found it most helpful to write my speech in paragraph form, then make notes, and rehearse using both as a reference. It took a little extra work, but I always liked having a comprehensive outline of what I was going to say.

I never played sports growing up, but I imagine my pre-speech ritual is a lot like some athletes. I like to get myself confident without overhyping myself and giving myself too great of an adrenaline rush. I listen to my favorite music, wake up early that morning to do a full routine and eat a good breakfast. Most importantly, I always try to wear my favorite work-appropriate outfit that balances comfort, sensibility, and style. I am fully in the ""look good-feel good- work better"" camp. 

Lastly, I know the rule is ""practice makes perfect,"" which is absolutely true for public speaking. But, the nature of public speaking renders true practice quite rare. My suggestion for practicing public speaking is to **have performative and spontaneous conversations.** If you're in line at the coffee shop and the person behind you is chatty, entertain them. Have more conversations with strangers. Think of a story and tell it to those who are willing to listen. And each time you tell it, pay attention to how the listener reacts and use those details to improve your story the next time you tell it. Talking to strangers can help you develop your public voice and improve your improvisational speech.

Read up on your subject more than you think you should and any underlying subject that integrates into your subject. 

If you think you have a good understanding of the subject, double the initial time spent studying to have a great understanding and then some. 

It takes 10,000 hours of practice to achieve excellence. Seriously, so remember you’re starting at the bottom and forgive yourself for making mistakes. 

Write the main topic of your speech. Subdivide by 3-5 secondary points and subdivide those into tertiary points. This is called ‘chunking’, it means separating the topic into chunks of easily remembered information. If you format your speech into smaller subjects, it’ll be easier to string them together. 

For example, remembering numbers is particularly difficult. Say you have to remember data, dates, etc. 

121,351,970 can be chunked into dates 12/1 is my husband’s birthday, 35 is my brother’s age, 1970 is my favorite decade. 121351970 is very easy to recall in that context... 

The next step is placing these subjects into your ‘memory palace’. This is essentially walking around a familiar place and placing the items you’d like to remember in certain places along the way. 

Continuing the example: I’m picturing my house. I walk through the front door and my husband is sitting at our table with a birthday cake. I then walk into my dinning room and my brother is holding up three fingers on one hand and five on the other. I walk into my living room and there is shag carpet, disco music is playing and That 70’s Show is on the TV. 

You can use these techniques for pretty much anything. It can get super complex, but you’ll be surprised how quickly you can recall information even in moments of stress. 

(Read Jonathan Safari Foer’s book, “Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Anything.” for more information on these subjects. It gives the exact skills for delivering naturally flowing speeches while also improving your memory all together. Bonus for public speakers!) 

Practice your speech on anyone and everyone willing to listen. If you don’t many close friends or relatives, practice on strangers. You’d be surprised how many people are willing to help. This also helps you concur the feeling of awkwardness and general discomfort. 

Make small public declarations, like a toast at a dinner party, evening with friend, or any social or non-social gathering. Keep it short and succinct. 

If appropriate, engage your audience. Ask questions to selected people and give them the appropriate time to answer. This immediately makes you feel at ease as well as engages those around you. 

You can also sense the nervousness of those who are selected and realize you’re not alone, because nervousness is natural and everyone feels it. So it’s best to recognize that and embrace those feelings.


If there are follow up questions and you’re struggling to find an answer practice saying, “let me get back to you on that.” Look at your research and make sure you get back to them. It’s shows people that you are serious and professional. 

I am a hairstylist and an educator for several brands over the years. I’ve giving hundreds of classes and it’s prepared me for other engagements. It’s extremely intimidating in the beginning, but you’ll notice as the knowledge of your craft and the strength in your position grows so will your public speaking abilities. 

Just remember that everyone in the room is in their head just as much as you are. They are concerned about their breath, is there something in their teeth on their pants, scanning the room for familiar faces, worried about their appearance, distracted from personal dramas, etc. 

If you can make them forget about these things while your speaking by engaging them with your content and/or delivery, they will recognize and remember your information. If not, they’ll continue thinking about the trivial things they’re consumed with. 

People very rarely remember their peers embarrassing moments. So if you fail in the beginning, you can rest assured that you can leave that experience behind and start preparing for your next public speaking event. 

Sorry for the diatribe, if you have any questions feel free to contact me!

In the context of a work, some part of the job may require caring as an integral part for it to be functional (psychology, health, social workers, etc).  Performative care is usually part of the formation, but it's the kind you actively know you are doing. There are mechanism in place to make you care in a professional setting for your patient and put up the appropriate boundaries. But even then it can lead to compassion fatigue (when the emotional labor you do to perform caring or even natural caring is too much).

The term ''performative caring'' is also used to talk about a new ''caring trend'' that started approx 5 years ago. Like a weird toxic positivity movement where coaches and TedX fanatics are all about putting in place a caring environment (intentions are noble, but it's still very fake and emotional labor intensive). 

Then there's my actual field of study (caring in the context of education). Best example I can give is that in STEM, students can have the harshest male professors and be okay with that, but if a female professor, then suddenly she is an incompetent bitch out to get them. The vocabulary used in student evals is highly correlated to the gender of the professor being evaluated. A lot of internalized misogyny, even within our woke genz generation!

So those women who get scorched for being rigorous and professional have to adopt a more nurturing approach, smile more and perform warmth to attenuate disrespect, stress and negative interactions in their workplace. I'm not implying that those male/female professors were not caring about their students in the first place. It's just that women have the pressure to display caring in an exaggerated stereotypical way to be on the same level as their male counterpart.

Example:  I was one of three women on my team writing code. Of the three women I was the only one who was able/willing to be emotionally intelligent enough to handle the egos of my male (and female) colleagues. 

I grew up with a dad that had an explosive temper. Think Dr Jekyll/Karen.  He is super smart and respectful until something doesn’t go his way and he would become verbally abusive and shame the person who disappointed him, often to the point of tears. I’ve gone to therapy and now I keep him at an arms length, but the skills that I learned to avoid angering him and handling his temper has helped me at work when my colleagues are disappointed or angry at each other. 

My project manager is a 6 on a scale of 1-my dad, temped wise. He will burst into meetings waving a ticket around like perry mason with the “gotcha” evidence demanding an explanation for why things people told him don’t add up. I have become his go to person because I sooth his mood, validate his feelings of disappointment, provide an explanation that fills in the gaps, and we always end meetings best friends again.

I’ve used my dad-gloves on just about everyone on my project and it has earned me the reputation of “The Mom” on my project. For a few months I was the only woman in my company’s corps of engineers (until I hired more).  During those months my project became known as “the successful project” since the male engineers didn’t understand how to manage the feelings of upper management. Our project has disasters and fires and bugs, I’m just good at making people feel ok about them. 

My CTO has noticed this and he has straight up asked why I’m so good at handling my project manager and other egos on the project and I was honest with him about my up bringing. He has since tried to keep his ego and temper in check, he truly is a gem among men. 

Because of my CTO realizing my worth my company won’t let me leave. They keep throwing money and titles at me every year because I start hinting that I want to move on.  They’ve now priced me out of the job market. I’m making double what I made last year, I’ve been promoted thrice in the past four years, and now all job offers I receive are a significant pay cut.  I’m actually not as educated, experienced, knowledgeable, or skillful as my male counterparts, but I can manage my managers better so I get promoted over them. I do sometimes bring this up, that they should promote my highly skilled coworkers, but my CTO says that they need to work on their communication skills to be worth a promotion.

The term originated when a female psychologist noticed a pattern of high achieving women who felt insecure that they weren’t good enough despite very clear objective achievements. There was a huge gap between their high levels of competence, skill and success and their low levels of confidence.

The term has since been bastardised to be used by anyone who is feeling like they’re not good enough - including when they objectively suck, are incompetent, are lazy, etc. Is it surprising that someone who is not good at their job is afraid they are not good at their job? No. That isn’t a phenomenon.

The difference in these two uses: in one case high achieving women feel they aren’t good enough imho because women are often subjected to double standards where no matter how good they are they are questioned, taken for granted, undervalued, gaslit, thus screwing with their self perception.

Meanwhile men on average are overconfident and society has more confidence in men, which means men are more likely to be promoted above their ability and then find themselves in situations where they don’t have adequate skill, knowledge, ability or wisdom to do their job properly and thus there is a reckoning where quite rightly they fear they are not good enough because they aren’t.

In such situations it’s not uncommon for insecure men to lean on highly capable women and take credit for their work, and reap the benefits of this by continuing to be promoted beyond their ability at the expense of those women. 

It’s not anyone’s benefit to enable this cycle. If this man is struggling with basics already, it will be even worse if he is promoted to senior (where he will be expected to mentor and onboard juniors amongst other things).

While we should all help our teammates, this is only true if that help is known and the manager is aware of the situation so they don’t incorrectly credit the work or promote the wrong person.

I guess the best way of looking at it, is to first understand proprietary code versus 3rd party code.

3rd party code is code that is provided to you by some outside source. In this case, external libraries like unity, open gl, or unreal engine.

Those libraries give access to the most core graphics functions like rendering, collisions, and transforms. 

Then there's the  code, which you are responsible for maintaining. This is the in shop code that is proprietary to the product line.

With all that said, lines of code is a rudimentary and pretty useless measurement of any kind. Two different snippets of code can easily accomplish the same goal and be drastically different lines of code.

&#x200B;

There are general guidelines like ""any individual method shouldn't be larger then 50 lines of code"", and ""any class should consist of less then 20 total methods"".

&#x200B;

The point of these guidelines (and object oriented programming in general) is to separate concerns when programming. Each function you write should have a single specific task that can be tested in isolation. This allows you release smaller individual components in isolation.

&#x200B;

Why are we separating concerns?

&#x200B;

We aren't doing it for the computers, we are doing it for the developers.

&#x200B;

Developers are human, and can only have ""so much in their head"" at any one time. If you had a single function that was 5000 lines long and performed everything from data storage, data processing, user input, and UI rendering then it would be extremely difficult for \*\*any\*\* engineer to effectively work on the code base, never mind collaborate with other developers.

&#x200B;

There's just too much going on in a highly coupled manner to fit in a human's brain at design time. If it is chunked into smaller parts, it's easier to work with.

It's the difference between ""working on a car"", and ""working on a rear axle.""

Impact matters more than intent. And by calling themselves a woman’s organization, and throwing nonbinary people in under that umbrella, it is exclusionary.

So, is this exclusionary? Well, maybe in places, and maybe on paper - but do you think exclusion is the intent?

There's a bit more to this too. Say if someone got full access to your site and had the salt and hash function too. They would still have to guess every password one by one. If you take an unsalted hash and put it into Google, Google will tell you it's value because someone has most likely already found it and posted it online.

If you salt a hash, even if someone uses a common password, the salt makes it unique so you can't just google it.

Also password cracking is so powerful these days you can't just use words and numbers, you have to either use a random string of characters that are at least 8 or 9 characters long, or words with symbols inserted (not replacing letters, adding new ones) in the middle of them. e.g. instead of *warhammer* you would do *wa%rhamm$er*",871,testimonial injustice,anyone get value without know hash function salt useless bit say someone get full access site salt hash function would still guess every password one one take unsalted hash put google google tell value someone likely already find post online salt hash even someone use common password salt make unique google also password crack powerful day use word number either use random string character least 8 9 character long word symbol insert replace letter add new one middle e g instead warhammer would wa rhamm er,"feel, like, manager, engineering, job",0.7855530188034828,"useless, dominant, punishable, misuse, defeated",0.5199999999999998,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.2436379055324077

Revised.*

It seems that people are not understanding what OP said, at least not fully.

The basic level of password storage a site should maintain is that they store the “hashed” equivalence of your password. This could, and probably will, be better described by others, but in general the site takes your password, applies a complicated function with other static values, and stores the output. Then, when a user enters a password to log in, it is put against that same process, and that output is compared to the stored value.  

Note that when you try to log in with your password the site hasn’t plucked a stored value from its database, turned it back into your password and compared them.  The site has taken what you’ve entered to log in, repeated some machinations, and compared its stored “gobblygook” to the new “gobblygook” it created by hashing what you’ve presented as your appropriate password.

Here’s a *very simplified* hash process, but it gives one an idea:

First, let’s understand “hashing”.  Hashing is a one-way “encryption”.  (*People that understand encryption will say it is not, and they’re right, but this post isn’t for them.*) You feed a hash a value, and it spits out a REAL LONG string.  You can’t take that REAL LONG string and work backward to your original string easily, it takes a “hunt and peck” approach.  So I tell it “hello”, and it thinks for a few computer ticks, and spits out a long-ass string.  It is a big chunk of text, but a hash algorithm will always return the exact same value if you pass it the same value.  

Now here’s something interesting.  If I pass it “hello”, or “hello123” or “hello124”, what it passes back is *dramatically* different for each.  Therefore, to eliminate the power of the “hunt and peck” approach to hacking a database of password, we “salt” it.

For the password “pasw123”
The site accepts your password, and then takes their own “salt” and ‘adds’ it to your password. For my example, my site’s salt is: -wetdog

So, I add those together, and I hand the hashing algorithm “pasw123-wetdog”.

As I’ve said above, it thinks for a few computer ticks, and spits out a real long string of characters.

I store that new value. If anyone got that value, without knowing my hash function, and my salt, it’d be useless. I therefore, as a site administrator, protect my salt.  There are a limited number of hash functions, but clearly, an unlimited number of made up salts.  As a matter of fact, any site administrator worth their salt (see what I did there) uses a salt that’s a long-ass meaningless string in and of itself.

So, when anyone logs in, the site takes the pw they entered, applies the same process listed, and only allows them in if it matches the salted hash stored in the database.

Disclaimers: 

* For ease of understanding I’ve GREATLY simplified how salt is applied.

* There are ways to take a database full of weakly hashed passwords and derive the original values. So, never assume any site is *fully* secure.

* Email isn’t secure. Therefore, regardless how the password was stored, even sending it out is problematic, because someone could intercept it and know your pw for that, and potentially other, sites.  As someone commented below, think of an email as a postcard (people can read it without you knowing) and not a letter.

* Why a hash cannot be worked backward is for another discussion, and need not really be understood to get that a website shouldn’t be storing your passwords ‘merely’ encrypted (a reversible process) or even worse, as straight text.",3721,testimonial injustice,edit jackle ftw point complicated salting revise seem people understand op say least fully basic level password storage site maintain store hash equivalence password could probably good describe others general site take password applies complicate function static value store output user enters password log put process output compare stored value note try log password site pluck stored value database turn back password compare site take entered log repeat machination compare store gobblygook new gobblygook create hash present appropriate password simplify hash process give one idea first let understand hash hash one way encryption people understand encryption say right post feed hash value spit real long string take real long string work backward original string easily take hunt peck approach tell hello think computer tick spit long ass string big chunk text hash algorithm always return exact value pas value something interesting pas hello hello123 hello124 pass back dramatically different therefore eliminate power hunt peck approach hack database password salt password pasw123 site accepts password take salt add password example site salt wetdog add together hand hash algorithm pasw123 wetdog say think computer tick spit real long string character store new value anyone get value without know hash function salt useless therefore site administrator protect salt limited number hash function clearly unlimited number make salt matter fact site administrator worth salt see us salt long as meaningless string anyone logs site take pw entered applies process list allow match salt hash store database disclaimer ease understand greatly simplify salt apply way take database full weakly hash password derive original value never assume site fully secure email secure therefore regardless password store even send problematic someone could intercept know pw potentially sit someone comment think email postcard people read without know letter hash work backward another discussion need really understood get website storing password merely encrypt reversible process even bad straight text,"feel, like, manager, engineering, job",0.7855530188034828,"useless, dominant, punishable, misuse, defeated",0.5199999999999998,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.25976818229998105

Skill is of course important, and people wouldn’t actually get the job if they didn’t have the skill to succeed. “Culture fit” is tricky, because it’s often been used as a blanket rejection against minorities in tech since people generally will hire people who remind them of themselves (personality, race, gender, background, etc).  Also, as tech gets bigger and more diverse we’re seeing that adding diversity to companies *benefits* the company itself, the culture, and the product. That’s because adding people with different POVs helps cover blind spots and adds fresh ideas/approaches.

Trying to remove bias from interviewing would be ideal but it realistically just cannot be done, at least not in our lifetime. So the best alternative is to continue to have anti bias training, make sure we have diverse interview panels and talent pools, and strive to give chances where we can.

All that being said, your boss’s behavior reminds me a lot of my own manager, only a bit worse. My manager is OK with the tech, he just seems to struggle hard with an anxiety disorder he clearly has never had formally addressed. He has to micromanage almost everyone who does any work for him, and of course that spills over into committee meetings and such as well, which can be embarrassing and even insulting.  Whenever he is the least bit uncertain of his ability to use the tech needed, his anxiety kicks in and he overreacts to the slightest of difficulties and mishaps. This sounds similar.

I apologise for being incoherent with my writing I just really need to pour my heart out somewhere.

I’m 30 years old from Israel, I work currently as a junior in a devops at a consulting company, I’m the only woman in the company, before that I was working in technical support for 3 months, I thought myself everything when the pandemic hit and I’m seriously on my last straw. 
I’m there for almost a year and it’s unbearable. I was so passionate and so excited to start working there but there more the time goes by the more my mental health is starting to deteriorate and I’m starting to have really dark thoughts, my siblings are the only things and keeps me going. 
I’m the main provider for my family and I left my home for this job and I was optimistic and so happy that I finally get a chance to grow at a career that I enjoyed so many years learning and trying by myself
My onboarding was a complete nightmare, I was promised a bootcamp or at least some help or explanations, some guidance, someone to talk to. 
Before I started to work there, for weeks on end I would sit on my weekends with a friend of mine on his projects and helping him find solutions for his projects, the moment I joined - he took distance and didn’t fully include me in the project in which I worked for free for days on end just because I really enjoyed it.
After o got accepted to the company I was promised a raise after 6 months and when I’ve asked to have a meeting after 8 months I was literally ghosted by the management, got an email about a raise which was less than 50% than anyone else in the company. 
Each day that I wake up to go to work I start my day with tears and unknowing what’s about to happen. 
I don’t get any feedback or actual opportunities to show my abilities, I feel left out to just drift and to show our clients “Here, we have a woman, we are inclusive”.
At first, I was just shoving myself into projects and sitting next to random people at the office to learn and watch them work, it was humiliating.
A senior architect joined our company and before he joined I was thrilled that maybe finally someone could actually mentor me or answer my questions without making me feel like a completely idiot, and then the first holiday came - the first company celebration, after a huge wave of firing, all the other juniors were fired except for me. And still, no one gives me any feedback on my work, I literally feel orphaned if that makes sense.
That senior gave a speech on how “juniors are lazy and don’t do anything” that made my blood boil.
A few months later, as a joke, I got called “white trash”. Needless to say I went home early just because I couldn’t hold my tears back. 
I hear the way they talk about their wives who help them, their girlfriends who take care of them, and it just breaks my heart little by little.
Right now I’m just hanging in the air, there’s a brutal war in my country, I’ve sent a message to my manager 3 days ago about the situation and that I am not able to leave the city to go back to work and he didn’t even answer me. I don’t know what’s happening with me in regards to my work.
I look at the people in the company from aside and I’m just very sad. I see them help each other, support each other, explain to each other and when I raise the topic I just get the response of “google exists”
I have done 5 major projects that each one of them have a different stack of technology 
I’ve never faced anything remotely close to something like this at a work place, i have been loved and appreciated at every workplace that I have worked at, I always got hugs and letters of appreciation when I left a job, it was always so difficult for me to leave the team that I have loved and it didn’t matter if it was at a luxury company or a simple factory, and I really didn’t want to believe that it’s like that.
I just had to pour my heart out, I don’t know if I can take it any longer. 
We had a woman who I was really good friends with but she very quickly quit because she realised how big of mess the company is in right now. 
I’m really lost, I feel so alone, and the scariest part is because I have touched and worked on so many stacks in so little time, I didn’t have the chance to get really good at something on a mid level so I could find another role, not only that, I hate lying and the fact that I can’t speak the truth about my company and how badly I feel there and I need to sugarcoat it makes me even more sad. 
I don’t know what to do, I don’t know who to turn to, I don’t know how to handle the situation and to not lose my future. 
I know that I’m probably alone in this situation and it may even sound extreme but I really don’t have anyone else to talk about it.

Its a combination of high infatuation and wanting friendship. In other words he doesnt know boundaries due to the influx of dopamine and emotion he has.

This is probably all new for him too. 

Its not your fault 

Document everything and be prepared for wrongful termination. Be prepared to sue if necessary. 

After you feel you have documented everything.

Consider a very straight forward message (email or in person) to Harold. Its better in person. 

Hey, can we not talk about dismemberment and these topics? I didnt want to be rude but its uncomfortable.

I really want to focus only on work. We can small talk about other things. 

I feel uncomfortable you are watching and messaging me.

I am not looking to make more friends or hang out at work or outside of work. I am nice to everyone and i dont want to give any false impressions im into you or anyone else. I am happily married. 

For OP: By actually talking about dismemberment and other dark topics with Harold, you inadvertently gave him several false impressions.

1. It was ok to talk about it with him. Hes overjoyed he met a female match who wasnt turned off. He didnt know how you really felt.

2. Harold pov:wow i made a cool female friend that can talk to me about topics im fascinated in. She even listens to me!!!"" Wow shes my dream girl!!!

Hence the infatuation and love songs.

Op. You have to be very direct, specific and respectful, and as kind as you can be..

Even then... You can expect misunderstandings. 
If you can't afford to lose your job. Be sure you have all sorts of evidence. Take screenshots of his text and calls 

Good luck!

Their job is to defend the company against lawsuits. They have no liabilty if you're hurt so its not their problem. The goal is to make it their problem by introducing financial liability to the company if you're hurt. I'll explain how generally. Countries vary.

Having experienced similar things ( sexual harassment, the death & dismemberment is a whole other level ), HR sat HIM down to explain where the lines are in terms of reducing the company's liability. They asked me pointed questions clearly making sure that the lines hadn't been crossed. I live in a country with EXTREMELY lax sexual harassment regulations ( USA ) ( side note: the former head of the agency that is supposed to regulate sex harassment was accused of sexual harassment while being nominated for the supreme court and still got it and remains there ). So, like, fuck. I think you're totally screwed on this.

If it were me, from my experience, I would ignore the sex/gender elements and bring up with HR IN WRITING that the discussions of death/dismemberment are a threat. Try to avoid softening the words. Don't say you perceive it that way. Don't say ""think"" or ""believe"" They are threats. He is threatening you. Full stop. Less words is more. Say as little as possible. Your coworker is threatening your physical safety. Quote him. That's it.

Keep everything in writing. When the company inevitably wants to chat face-to-face. Take notes. with quotes. Then email them your notes immediately after with a statement like ""Here are the notes from our discussion."" Make it very visible you are doing so. Carry a notepad with you starting immediately.

However, we're always going to have toxic people, men & women, no matter what we do and where we go.  What we do control is how we respond them. As you said above, it wasn't everyone.  So what I do is control how I respond to those toxic people and how much power I let them have over us (queue some corney quote about positive thinking).

Separately, it might be helpful to read about guy's experiences in mostly all women environments to get a different perspective on these types of challenges (male elementary school teachers, male nurses, etc.)  It might help give you a perspective on how to approach male dominated environments.

Also, I hope you don't consider banter toxic.  It's how you know you're accepted with a lot of guys.  Now, there are some people out there that are too emotionally fragile to engage in banter (both guys and girls) and it's considered a bit of an asshole thing to do to engage in heavy banter with people who can't take it and dish it right back.  You have every right to call assholes out for being assholes.

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:35,2019-09-04 12:36,cosmeticsnerd,Comment,Amazing thread with lots of badass women in engineering,eyzd2yd,,"I'm a software engineer and I've had mostly positive experiences, with one glaring exception - a former coworker sexually assaulted me, but management/hr and my coworkers believed and supported me, and did everything in their power to make me feel safe at work after it happened, even though there wasn't much they could do about it officially since he had already left the company. I was fortunate, but there are ways to tell when you're applying for jobs whether a company takes women seriously, and looking for the green flags has made a big difference in my career.

When I've looked for jobs, I have always paid attention to whether they have women in executive and VP-level positions, and especially whether they have women in leadership positions on the engineering team. I've always chosen companies that had women at the head of the engineering department and (depending on company size) at least one other woman in a senior/executive leadership role. (The woman leading engineering when I started my job has since left, but half of the executive leadership team is women and a third of the VPs are women, so I feel comfortable where I'm at.) I really can't overstate how much this sets the tone and shapes the culture at an engineering company. If they aren't hiring women in leadership roles, it's a strong sign that they don't give a shit, because qualified women leaders are *out there* \- sure, they make up a smaller proportion of the candidate pool in engineering, but that's not necessarily the case when it comes to marketing, legal, product, etc. Even when it comes to engineering, the previous generation of software engineers getting their degrees in the 70s and 80s was around 37% women, and even when you factor in attrition from the field, that generation of women engineers is still 20-25% women. That's a much higher percentage of women than we're seeing complete computer science/software engineering degrees today (18% of new grads.) I'd consider making an exception to this rule for a brand new startup, but I'd have to be very confident in the leadership team to go for it.

I also ask about formal mentorship programs and processes for giving feedback to higher-ups at job interviews. I didn't have that at my first job and my career stagnated while I was there. At my current job, I have weekly meetings with my team lead and my manager focused on my technical and professional growth. Those meetings are also an opportunity to give *them* feedback on how I think they're doing. I've given negative feedback before (about how they handled a meeting, about feeling micromanaged, etc) and I've never been retaliated against. Mentorship has been instrumental in helping me work through stuff like impostor syndrome - there's nothing like hearing someone experienced tell me what I'm *good* at - and feedback being a two way street has also proved important for my career. For example, if a senior male engineer treats a more junior woman engineer with condescension when she asks for help, she should be able to tell him (or his boss) that his behavior was dismissive and disrespectful. I've been treated that way before and it can do a number on your confidence, and if there's no avenue for giving that kind of critique, ""little"" toxic behaviors like that just fester and erode trust.

Point is, if you love the work, I don't think you should avoid the field because of sexism in the industry. It's not rare, but it's not pervasive, either. No company is free of assholes - nobody I worked with had any reason to believe that the guy who assaulted me would do something like that until I told them what happened, and you can't assume that working at a company that supports women means that all your coworkers are trustworthy, but looking for green flags can give you a good (not perfect!) sense of whether a company is likely to support you or brush things under the rug.",3903,testimonial injustice,software engineer mostly positive experience one glare exception former coworker sexually assault management hr coworkers believe support everything power make feel safe work happen even though much could officially since already leave company fortunate way tell apply job whether company take woman seriously look green flag make big difference career look job always pay attention whether woman executive vp level position especially whether woman leadership position engineering team always choose company woman head engineering department depend company size least one woman senior executive leadership role woman lead engineering start job since leave half executive leadership team woman third vps woman feel comfortable really overstate much set tone shapes culture engineering company hire woman leadership roles strong sign give shit qualified woman leader sure make small proportion candidate pool engineering necessarily case come market legal product etc even come engineering previous generation software engineer get degree 70s 80s around 37 woman even factor attrition field generation woman engineer still 20 25 woman much high percentage woman see complete computer science software engineering degree today 18 new grad consider make exception rule brand new startup confident leadership team go also ask formal mentorship program process give feedback high ups job interview first job career stagnate current job weekly meeting team lead manager focus technical professional growth meeting also opportunity give feedback think give negative feedback handle meeting feel micromanaged etc never retaliate mentorship instrumental help work stuff like impostor syndrome nothing like hear someone experience tell good feedback two way street also prove important career example senior male engineer treat junior woman engineer condescension asks help able tell boss behavior dismissive disrespectful treat way number confidence avenue give kind critique little toxic behavior like fester erode trust point love work think avoid field sexism industry rare pervasive either company free asshole nobody work reason believe guy assault would something like told happen assume work company support woman mean coworkers trustworthy look green flag give good perfect sense whether company likely support brush thing rug,"feel, like, manager, engineering, job",0.7532718203518116,"disrespectful, abusive, uncivil, degrading, abuse",0.3118777893844289,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.5674279970212617

A lot of times what you *perceive* as slower is due to bloat from things you install, like having multiple versions of DLLs hanging around or a lot of applications trying to start up at once (particularly right after you log in).  Formatting and reinstalling (or using the OS's ""reset"" feature) will usually produce a very notable speedup even on modern OSs.

In general software tends to get slower over time too, as code gets bloated, and we move farther ""away from the metal"".  Back in the day one application ran at a time, then we could run multiple applications at a time but a misbehaving app could take down the whole system, then we started to get more process isolation, then we have things like web browsers and Java VMs and hypervisors that maintain their own levels of isolation, etc.  At the end of the day, we are using hundreds of thousands of times as much processor power to do word processing that you could do on a Z80 back in 1980.

There is also the angle of improved productivity... you could certainly write a Java program in C++ and it would be much faster, but it would also take a lot more time to develop and maintain that software.  Modern development in a high-level language is really more like playing with legos - you are hooking up Library A to Library B and then doing some specific task with them.  At the end of the day hardware is cheap, and programmers are expensive (and don't scale well, 10x the programmers is not 10x the productivity, so 1 programmer doing the work of 10 with code reuse and high-level languages is a bargain).

We basically almost never agree on anything, and he is not able to articulate reasons why he is doing something a certain way, so some discussions have felt like a waste of time on my part, as I used to spend a lot of time reviewing his code and adding detailed comments with explanations, to have my comments being dismissed or ignored without providing a valid reason.

Right now, I'm really actively looking for a new team, and as I do that I have tried to avoid getting into more conflicts. It's been easy to not review his code anymore, as there are always other people who are available to review. The issue is that he often comes to my pull requests and leaves comments that are about minor or irrelevant issues, which sometimes results in lengthy discussions about nothing. But fine, it's the price to pay - I also don't want to have these discussions in 1-1s or meetings, as I also feel these are very unproductive in our team, as people often start talking about tangential topics, and we often lose the thread of things. There's another senior developer on the team, but he tends to avoid conflict, and usually stays out of it.

I realise this is also a failure on my part on managing the situation, but right now I'm really just focused on getting out, and don't want to spend more than the minimum amount of effort trying to improve things, so sorry for that.

However, I have seen some disparaging comments from him about some of my work, due to some bugs that are actually also a consequence of upstream changes from a team whose code we are using, so it's hard to tell if the comments are directed at me or at the other team. These comments are done in a generic way, like for example ""things are messed up right now"", which is also not the most technically precise way to present issues.

I also think this dude is a bit incompetent, as he has been dealing with this codebase longer than me and doesn't have basic understanding of the core parts of it, so he basically usually pings the other team when there is something he can't figure out. Recently, I was on leave for a few days he was not also able to figure out how to fix a simple bug (which btw I fixed with a 1 line change when I got back). When someone asked about it, he said that I was the one who should know about it, because I wrote all the code related to the feature where the bug was found. This is strange, as my PRs always get a lot of questions and comments from him, so I would expect him to know what was done there.

So my question to you is: how should I proceed in these types of situations? Should I ignore him, and just go about doing my work, or should I reply to each of these comments in kind (obviously, in a professional and correct way)?

I had just pushed up some code changes to GitHub, and noticed that CI was failing due to a test for a file that my PR hadn't touched. I reached out to the dev who wrote the failing test (who is both relatively new to the team and a level below me) to see if he'd encountered any similar issues when he originally wrote the test - just to avoid going down a debugging rabbit hole if it wasn't necessary. He replies with 'No, but maybe you should rm -rf node\_modules and try again', and then 'sorry, that was nerd speak for delete node\_modules and reinstall them - you probably didn't know that.'  


I mean, excuse me? Do you really, honestly, think that I've gotten this far in my career without knowing what the 'rm -rf' command is? I know this just a small slight, but I can't help wondering what this guy must think of me if he thinks that I don't know basic shell commands...

Every few years,  a new male intern or some fresh outta college, self proclaimed bro 10x-er decides he knows more than me. It usually starts as small backhanded compliments or arguing with me about humiliatingly simple ideas in excruciatingly round about ""holier than thou"" ways. I usually just let their hubris self implode their release schedule: ""ok, sounds like you don't need nor want assistance with this high severity security defect. Let me know when you resolve the code issue and are ready for release."" ... and then I block it due to an unsatisfactory resolution to the open vuln, letting them explain to their leader why they missed their target release date and refused my assistance. Even more fun if they raise a stink and I have to forward the email chain to their leader exhibiting their lack of cooperation and respect when I offered assistance. 


Fun side note: I usually dress very casual and somewhat gay (think flannels, button downs, hoodie vests, and addidas shoes) (fyi, I am gay so, yeah). But when I am meeting a new person or team for the first time I dress up in a cute yet smart business dress + cardigan (though still with addidas). I show up to the meeting 5 minutes early before folk show up and keep my head down into jira or the wiki, minimizing all my shell windows. More often than not, the other attendees assume I am a PM, and talk freely while we wait for the ""engineer"" to show up - sometimes their conversation includes some ""interesting"" and (rarely) insulting comments about dealing with infosec. Once I heard comments about how they wish they had one of the ""guys"" from infosec, as the women are usually late to the ""party"" and most likely just went to boot camp a few years ago. The look on their faces when I start the meeting 5 minutes in, introducing myself as the engineer... yeah, i fuck with the bros heads, keeps me entertained and keeps them on their toes. And the real bonus is that sometimes they are so embarrassed that they hopefully learn a good lesson about decorum and respect... potentially saving the next female engineer they interact with from their bro bullshit.


In my experience, women in IT have to work twice as hard as the men for half as much respect. Women have to be perfect and back their confidence up with cold hard results, where the men often get the benefit of the doubt. Also, I often have to be accepted as ""one of the guys"" before I have their actual respect, instead of them assuming I am capable based on my title and experience.

Like to reply, ""is that something you had trouble understanding? lol yeah, obviously not boxes"" – to act like whatever condescending thing they're explaining is something they had trouble understanding (other things in this line would be a ""did you just figure that out?""). But, while that feels good to do it's not a useful path as you wanted help and this person is helping you.

So, the higher road path is to ignore tone and focus on the information. That's the path I aim to follow. In this case the answer would be a ""yes, I understand that. What I want to understand is X/Y/Z?"" The less you engage the tone / ""joke"" the better. Focus on how you get to the information you want to get out of the conversation. Then, afterwards, vent to people that get it and move forward. The goal is for you to grow and learn, the cost of getting information from that person is to deal with a tone you have to ignore. 

A very smart engineer told me that she dealt with a guy that was condescending to everyone (regardless of gender) - she completed ignored his tone and just focused on what she could learn. She said that eventually the guy stopped talking down to her (though he still talked down to other people), maybe because she never rose to his bait.

The other thing is to seek out people that have a communication style that gels with you, and ones that you can ask ""dumb"" questions to (which is any question you feel you ""should"" know) – people that won't make you feel dumb for asking those questions. I'm glad that I work with a bunch of lovely devs who aren't condescending and will take the time to explain things (I'm a technical product manager, not a programmer but often need to expand my understanding of tech concepts).

People deliberately trying to talk over my head, interrupting what I’m saying or just completely ignoring me. 

I took advice from my aunt who was the only woman on an all male executive team for a prominent publishing company. She said she had the same experience until one day one of them spoke to her in a condescending manner and she said - what the fuck are you talking about? And after that she called it like it was, clear and frank and they responded well to that. 

So taking that advice I make it clear that I respect others and have the same expectations. If I’m interrupted I tell them I wasn’t finished speaking and continue. The trick is to do it without malice and firmly. People treat you the way you let them and I try to set the expectation. 
In my experience when you stand up to someone and put them in their place they typically refrain.

There was a developer at my last job known for being a dick to women. Our first meeting started out like this and I shut it down right away and he was quiet and respectful after that. One day I went into a meeting where he was berating another woman asking her questions and interrupting her answers with more rude questions. I answered one of his questions and said - she just told you the answers but you were rudely interrupting her and you would of heard it first hand if you weren’t talking over her. He instantly turned apologetic and quiet.

This hasn’t been the case with everyone but majority of the time. I also worked with a much older programmer - prob mid to late 50s - and he disagreed with a strategy I was implementing. I told him point blank I respect his experience and perspective but ultimately it was my decision.

Fortunately there were some nice people who joined in on the discussion, and one of them directed me here.

You can see the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/efzibn/women_learning_programming_how_do_you_deal_with/).

Since there was some misunderstanding on the last post, I just wanted to clarify that I'm not asking for interpretation of this story. I'm just sharing it, venting a little, and wondering how to handle condescending comments from men in the tech industry in the future. I'm concerned about how to handle sexist / condescending comments in the workplace, and I want to go in knowing how to handle it once I'm able to start applying for programming jobs.

I copied and pasted what I originally wrote here:

 

>I just recently began learning programming, and I had a very frustrating experience with a male friend of mine. We used to work together in work study during college, and we would repair computers together. Same colleague helped me to build my first computer. Same colleague and I had a conversation about memory partitions just a few days ago while we were all out to dinner with friends. The point being, we know each other and we've had technical conversations before.  
>  
>Fast forward to today. I set up my first virtual machine, and I decided to go with Xubuntu. I sent him a message asking about what other systems he recommended, and he recommended Arch. We were talking about the primary functions of Arch and why it's useful, and this was our verbatim conversation, copied from our messages:  
>  
>Friend: ""All these distributions of linux are very similar in function. Many of them are built for a specific purpose""

>What actual person would think we were talking about physical boxes? At first I brushed it off and we continued our conversation, but the more that I think about it, the angrier I'm becoming. It's obviously something I'll experience again, so... women programmers, how do you handle these situations?

It is definitely great advice but if you’re anything like me (the least confrontational person you’d ever meet), it might be easier said than done. Taking the Gandhi approach has been working for me way better, so the following is YMMV. 

* **Start by assuming that everyone has a level of respect for you and you can only lose it.** 
* Give people the benefit of the doubt and assume that whatever they said was not meant as offensive. Stick to the HR rule: if HR would have trouble ruling it as inappropriate, then let it pass and prove them wrong later. Worst way to lose someone’s respect is be all bark and no bite.
* Actions speak way louder than words and it works both ways here. First, Peers can say whatever they want to you, but if they’re not actively messing with your day to day life, ignore them, move on. Second, say less and do more. Remember, no one can read your mind, even if it’s filled with imposter syndrome thoughts. But, they *can* see what you’re doing so use this opportunity to show the naysayers that you can produce. If you give them words, they can use the words to argue. Can’t argue with results. 
* Build trust by being a good listener. Honestly, I didn’t expect this to happen, but because doing the above for a  year I became known as the quiet, chill girl, so people started going to me for advice.  One very senior guy once went to me first with his big idea and when I asked why me, he said that I’m “the only one around here who doesn’t have a stick up their ass”. We then got to discuss his project and he actively took my technical advice, even though I’m several levels his junior. I’m now a part of several high profile projects and these older dude engineers have my back. 

For comparison, a female coworker of mine has the worst combination: she’s very assertive and doesn’t take shit from anyone, but her impostor syndrome is too severe. What ends up happening is she calls people out if they’re condescending, but then she dwells on it and starts believing it. So not only does it set her back on her work, but it also puts pressure on her to produce, plus reinforces the stereotype for her. Others started to notice and now walk on eggshells around her.

TL;DR: act as if your male peers have the same amount of respect for you as other male peers. Don’t lose this respect by accidentally fitting the “women take everything emotionally and out of proportion” stereotype. Instead, move on, vent to someone outside work if needed, and do your job to prove people wrong.

life. I’m in construction and finance. 

Document everything. If push comes to shove with a bad hr you might be able to sue for a nice sum of money. Though this can be hard to do and isn’t always successful.

Here’s what I do in some of your examples. It works but it can be hard and isolating. If you can find one guy to back you up it will be easier. Having an ally makes everything better.

If I’m talked over and interrupted I have two default responses. I either raise my voice slightly, and just keep talking. I act like they don’t exist. This just floors them and makes everyone super uncomfortable.

Or when they finish I say something like, if you’re done interrupting me I’ll continue what I was saying, and then just look at them. Be prepared for temper tantrums at which point I’ll say something like, you seem to be having lots of emotions about this right now. Should we take a break and revisit after you have had time to calm down? (I use this anytime I see men get emotional and be abusive/sexist)

When basics are “mansplained” to you, turn it around on them. Repeat back to them in this cheerful praise voice. I’m so glad you understand the concept. You really have this down. If you have any more questions you can follow up with me, and then a big smile. “He’s such a good boy” behavior.

Being cut out of meetings or denied information. I’ll also call them out on it. I’ll interrupt the meetings and specifically point out that lack of inclusion. Ask them point blank if they are trying to cause the project to fail. 

As for your skip level. If he’s losing respect for you and being passive aggressive well he’s not really your ally is he? How I deal with passive aggressive behavior is call it out. Explicitly. I’m sorry can you explain that? I don’t understand? How is that funny please explain it? What is the problem pleas explain it.

My advice is this - sit down with your manager and tell him you are going to speak and he is going to listen. 

Tell him that you are well aware of how valuable you are to the company and the upcoming project. That you are thrilled to be getting this opportunity. But you won't be there so do it if things don't change NOW. 

Then list all the things you expect to be different. 

Give specific examples and be very clear on the changes you are insisting on and who needs to make these changes. Tell him the changes are to be made with immediate effect without exception.

Tell him you don't want to ever hear him say sorry or feign empathy again. That he either takes your issues seriously and shows you the respect you deserve as a senior member of his team who is critical to everyone's success, or you will have to reconsider your position with the company.

Tell him you love your job and want to remain there but the contempt with which you are treated, the hostility, and sheer lack of professionalism is unbearable and not worth the money they are paying you. 

If you are able to, I'd also have his manager there and possibly someone from HR too. 

You have been far too passive here and while I absolutely understand why, they won't respect you until you force them to. 

Hit them where it hurts by telling them you will leave and they will end up failing to deliver a critical project that will most likely cost them their jobs. 

In addition, you need to stand up for yourself every time you are cut off in a meeting (""I'm still speaking""), every time you don't get information (""why wasn't this sent to me, as the lead developer I need to know this""), or when they disregard your suggestions (""explain to me how you would do this if you're sure my ideas won't work""). 

Be passive aggressive if you need to but play the game of office politics. It's being played around you and simply saying that you don't want to get involved  means you're allowing them to exclude and disrespect you. 

If you won't advocate for yourself how can you expect anyone else to? 

How can you make this a safe environment for other women id you cant do it for yourself?

- is the tech lead the only person to ask, or are there seniors or long standing team members who have this knowledge? Sometimes tech leads are more removed from the code & unavailable because they are stuck in meetings all the time, and others who are actively working on the code and have been there a long time can be most familiar.

- what is the timeframe until you will lead it? It sounds like it won’t be soon, as no clear time period is mentioned? I would suggest integrating as a good senior team member before trying to flex your lead skills. Build trust & respect with your team members (who you will lead one day).

- when asking multipart questions verbally, ask one part at a time, so you get one answer for each part. Otherwise, submit in writing with itemised list of what you need to know.

- perhaps start by writing the missing documentation, document whatever you learn, get it reviewed to ensure your understanding is correct. Your questions can then be framed from a documentation point of view (providing value to the team).

- what I have learned the hard way is that there is no point providing suggestions to someone who is unwilling to listen to them. What is likely at play here is a power dynamic or ego and this tech lead wants to do things their way without question, and you’re only going to get into conflict if you try to change that while they are still lead. 

- Make notes for yourself on what you’d like to change when you have the opportunity, and also as you get to know your teammates tease out their thoughts: they’ve been on the team a while and will have some understanding of what is and isn’t working, what they think needs to be changed, and it will be easier to lead them if you incorporate their ideas and give credit to them for it.

- when it gets closer to the time you take over, ask the stakeholders what they want, what has and hasn’t been working about how the team currently works with them, and identify ways that you taking that lead role can provide better value to them rather than you just trying to replicate how the current lead does things (unless they are happy with how things are: then keep doing it).

Why would those be the only 2 scenarios I should consider? *That's* the thing I find frustrating - people hinting at the hopelessness of protecting their data privacy, and at the same time willingly operating within a technology framework that forces them to hand over their data.

Consider these scenarios:

I'm confused on what you're trying to say here, so I'll break down how an Echo works:

1. The Amazon Echo is always listening. It listens locally, and does not transmit data to Amazon. We can confirm this is how the device works, because we can monitor the network for incoming and outgoing packets.

2. The Echo listens and stores a buffer, about 2-3 seconds big, of what you say. It's overwritten. i.e. only the last 2 seconds of stuff is stored there. Again, it does not transmit.

3. Once that device hears you say the wake word, it sends the contents of the buffer and anything you say afterward to Amazon. Amazon processes this data and sends a response back.

4. The device goes back to sleep, waiting for the wakeword.

In step 3, your voice data is sent to Amazon. Then and only then is the data sent. Amazon keeps that recording for some amount of time or forever. 

So, in short, Amazon has the following data:

When you say the wake word


* 2-3 seconds of what you were saying before you said the wake word


* You saying the wake word


* What you said after saying the wake word, until you stop talking.



That's it.

So why did Law Enforcement ask for the recordings? Clearly they have to have ALL the voice data for it to be useful, right?

two options:

1. The victim was perhaps clairvoyant enough to say the wake word for the express purpose of this potentially happening in the future.

or

2. The cops are stupid. Amazon has to play ball with them because they have to because they are a company in the US. They can tell the cops its useless, it doesn't matter. They got the legal right to get that data, amazon hands it over.

This is actually *very* common for marginalized folks. There's a lot of sexism and racism in engineering disciplines in universities, and women often experience a lot of pressure to move out of these disciplines.

We may have some disagreement on this point. The most rigorous multivariate analyses show that gender discrimination only makes up something like 2% of of the total disparity in pay. ( if you want I will add the study Im referring to to get the exact details)

After a silence that seemed to last an eternity, he said he was disappointed in me for accepting that. He said I was smart, hard working and to always fight for my self. He ended up giving me a 5% raise for the duration of my contract, a healthy bonus and an amazing reference.


Fast forward a few years and I was looking to transition back into a newly created role at his firm. He told me the salary and I quickly countered back with about 5k more. He smiled and  asked why I thought I deserved more than the base salary. Without missing a beat, I said that a wise man once told me I was smart, hard working and to fight. He gave me the job,  increased salary, and even continued to pay my wages when I was very sick last summer and unable to work.

Yes a study of around 2000\-2500 people can be generalized to 126 million with a 2&#37; margin of error. Here's a calculator for you: [https://www.checkmarket.com/sample\-size\-calculator/](https://www.checkmarket.com/sample-size-calculator/)

Here's an article using plain english explaining the concept: [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/howcan\-a\-poll\-of\-only\-100/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/howcan-a-poll-of-only-100/)

Essentially it's all about math. If you have a massive box full of 126 million pieces of paper of different colours, and you draw out 2500 pieces of paper you can determine how many of each colour likely exists in the box based simply on probability. Similar to the concept that if you roll a 20 sided die 126 million times, you're going to get each outcome a roughly equal number of times \(unless the die is weighted or something.\) 

It's all about probability. Once you have that many samples in the data set it becomes very unlikely that your data is incorrect \- assuming you randomly selected and did not intentionally target certain groups to bias the result. 

The number of businesses doesn't really matter that much, because we're not studying business practices but the behaviour of women. And we're not making conclusions about those businesses.

ladydevs,hot,2023-10-24 21:07,2018-05-17 13:35,babylock,Comment,"Women rarely counter-offer their salary, but listen, do it! Don’t be afraid to ask for more!",dz53edq,,"My point is that every position requires analysis and contemplation.

As you can see from the article I linked above, women actually knew when to negotiate and when to not negotiate (when negotiation was likely to fail), suggesting that women may be able to “ read the room” for pay negotiation and determine themselves that negotiation would result in failure. This provides an interesting insight into this debate, as it suggest women, having grown up in an environment of discrimination in which pay discrimination is one facet, may actually be making the “smarter” decision in not negotiating, as the choice is between not negotiating and less pay/not being hired versus not negotiating and more pay.

However, as you will note, the study I referenced is a laboratory controlled scenario (the second is not), opening the potential for this not to play out in reality.

What the studies to suggest, unequivocally, as I indicate in my first sentence above, is that every position is in some way political/philosophical and serves a social function. In other words, broad social acceptance of one position as “the right explanation” has [potentially unintended] consequences.

What is the consequence of blaming the individual fully and completely for this issue [the most extreme position of the perspective you provide above]? 

The consequence is that the opportunity to investigate/determine whether a systemic social issue is at play is avoided. 

If low pay is the fault of the women who fails to “lean in,” the systemic issue of offering lower pay to women or [as investigated by the articles above] punishing women for negotiating goes uninvestigated and unexamined.  This serves a secondary [and again, perhaps unintentional] purpose as it absolves businesses [and perhaps greater society] from fault. 

It’s not that businesses don’t take kindly to “bitches” or “bossy” women who ask for a raise or demand a higher offer to accept a position, it’s that the women [who perhaps perceive this antagonistic atmosphere] failed to negotiate. Then prominent female feminist businesswoman and Ivy League business schools don’t have to examine how structural issues perpetuated by their protégés or graduates result in an environment which promotes women being paid less. 

It’s easier if it’s individual sexism, not systemic or entrenched sexism just as it’s easier if the environment can be saved by individuals turning off their faucets between brushing their teeth as opposed to a major revamp of agrabusiness. Or [a more exaggerated example to illustrate my point] if segregation were just an individual disagreement some [black] students had with their local movie theater or restaurant. 

My point was merely that reframing the argument is useful and provides insight. I would never want to suggest failing to negotiate pay is not an issue, as there is a clear benefactor in that as well, but who benefits from non-nuanced arguments?

Having several rejections in a row is dispiriting, and it can be hard to keep going. But you will be able to get through, and you will get a job.

Some random suggestions:

* Apply to companies that are a lower maturity level. A series-A company will be a lot more flexible than a public company or a late-series IPO. More mature companies can be a bit more arrogant, since people value them for their stability. They might set up leetcode style interviews or use filtering mechanisms like HackerRank. A startup might well skip that style of interviewing altogether (but they also might not want to hire IC1, IC2 level people).  To get this information if it's not in the job description, just search the company name and ""crunchbase""
* Use LinkedIn kind of aggressively to see how your college friends are making out.  Ask them politely but directly if they have jobs available at their company.
* Ask your professors, especially a machine learning or data science one, if they have recommendations for job hunting.  They may also have projects to complete, which you could put on your resume. (You don't have to say you were unpaid: it looks like graduate work.)
* Your school likely has an office that can help you with resume writing and interview prep. Give them a try.
* Tailor your resumes to the job description.  That is, if your resume says ""web dev experience"" but the job description says ""full-stack web developer needed to ..."", then you should change your resume to include ""full-stack"".  You're doing this to get a higher score in their ATS system (if they have one) or to get your resume past a non-technical recruiter who is just looking for keyword matches.  *It does not matter* if the ultimate hiring manager would understand the difference: use the same keywords to get past the filters.
* Glassdoor frequently has information on interview practices, sometimes even listing the problems. Check those out for every company before you show up.
* Research every company: what's going in the news, about them or their industry. It's easy to lose a borderline interview by showing complete ignorance or indifference about the company. Even the worst interviewer is somewhat invested in the company, so doing research signals interest and due diligence.
* Least pleasant of all, do more actual practice on these questions, using Cracking the Coding Interview or other resources. It's not pleasant, but many companies can't see past using them.

Before that, I was going through the motions of getting into software engineering because a lot of my peers were, and I figured that I’d be able to eventually grow into the role that I was meant to be in in the future, with SWE as a safety net.

I found myself really really disliking studying SWE interview questions, and didn’t apply to any internships. On a whim I took a machine learning and data science class the later half of my junior year. I loved everything I did in those classes. I was overjoyed that I found something meaningful to me to pursue a career in.

While preparing to land interviews for internships my senior year, I went through domestic violence in my family, had to plan to graduate a little later, completely upend my life and stay from friend to friend before finding my own place, while receiving rejections from 80+ companies in 2021.

I had to take a job as a waitress for several months because I really needed the money. It was still my dream to land in tech.

I’ve interviewed at a handful of companies this month. Though I eventually got rejections from all of them, I’m so proud because I hadn’t gotten this many requests to interview and “move forward”… ever. I even made it to the final stage with one company! They also rejected me, but it still felt like a major accomplishment.

I had recently interviewed with this big company that made me feel completely dumb, incapable, and disrespected. It was the 2nd stage technical interview. Not only did my interviewer ask me what role I was interviewing for, and shush me with his finger while he answered his phone, I was hit with those same SWE-related questions I disliked, and I couldn’t answer them without using any libraries. I would say they were the easy SWE questions, and I still couldn’t answer them. He told me at the end of it that he was using those questions to test my logic.

I know that I’m not completely devoid of logic, but sitting there, staring at my stressed out face and hair in the zoom window, kind of already beat down, and hearing and seeing this person from this big company tell me my logic wasn’t that great really bummed me out. I think it’s the best idea right now for me to pause with applying for a week or so.

As someone (I'm female) who once managed a team of developers and QAs with only one female developer on the team.... I have to say the experience was quite opposite. The team was so eager to hire and retain females on the team I felt they bent over backwards to her every whim. She had this sense of arrogance and entitlement like I have never seen before; she was extremely soft spoken so I didn't pick it up at first. She was the most junior on the team and everyone made it a point to make her feel welcomed and offered to mentor her whenever she needed help. She always complained about not being heard so I went out of my way to add agenda items to carve out time for her to share her input (she still didn't feel heard). She complained about not enjoying the work she was assigned so I moved mountains to assign her to the projects that SHE had asked to work on while other team mates graciously picked up and complete her half baked projects. She couldn't deliver on the project she hand picked and blamed it on the project being stupid. She complained about not getting opportunities to understand how the batch process worked so I, again, found opportunities for her to learn how to run it during business hours in a test environment to minimize risk. She didn't ""feel like doing it"" so she passed on the opportunity. She was apparently *ecstatic* about leaving our company.... A month into the new job she wanted to come crawling back cause (SURPRISE, SURPRISE) she hated everything and everyone at the new workplace.

Ways to vet: 

 \- Read between the lines on the job listing. Watch for statements like work hard, play hard, 10x developers, ninja, rockstar, watch for benefits that target young men but not other demos (foosball, happy hours, gym, but no parental leave benefits for e.g.) It shows you who they value enough to put dollars behind.

 \-  Look for pictures of the company - how diverse is it, do they have a page/statement/commitment to equal employment? This is base level stuff they should have. Do they have women in leadership positions? Even better. 

\- Look on glassdoor and other company review sites to see what other women have said about the company.

 \- In your interviews, did you get to interview with a woman? In companies I've worked in and liked, we even got women from other teams to interview with women candidates so they'd have a woman to talk to. We made it clear that the woman was from a different team. It shows awareness that the team might be lacking in diversity.

\- In the interviews, are the male interviewers smug or mocking in anyway? Do they comfortably make eye contact and communicate respectfully? Do they seem kind? Do they listen to what you are saying on behavioral questions, or are just waiting to ask the next q? Are they trying to help you succeed in the interview or hoping to see you fail? These are your future coworkers, super important to get a good vibe from them. Doubly important if you get to interview with your future manager.

\- Remember to weigh a bit more highly your evaluation of your team than companywide policies. You can have a great experience with a good team in a shitty company, I definitely have. You can also have a shitty experience with a bad team in a good company, though hopefully you can shortcircuit that and move to another team.

Then I made them pull up the documentation and show me them configuring the deployment. Thank goodness my client said okay to an extra pilot this week or it would have set the project back a week.

I was laid off from both. I also have a degree in CS. I’m currently scrambling to re-study data structures and algorithms, as well as general interview prep. I have no issues getting interviews and passing phone screens, but once I hit the technical interview portion, I freeze up. I also don’t know a lot when it comes to DSA and trade offs in using different technologies, and I forget a lot of stuff about past projects I’ve worked on. Am I just a bad software engineer? Even if I am, what are the ways I can improve? Or am I just not cut out for this career? How can I retain info better?

What I’m doing now:
- mock interviews with friends
- leetcode M-F
- reading CTCI and considering watching the MIT courses on DSA
- udemy courses on tech stacks I’m interested/software patterns and design

EDIT: Thanks so much for the overwhelming support! It has really lifted my spirit and encouraged more of a growth mindset in myself. To those who may be struggling with some similar issues, I’ll post some key takeaways when I have more time.

EDIT 2: Key takeaways
- practice makes perfect, including live coding/DSA problems
- on retaining info: keep a journal of work you have done. Challenges, what you liked, technologies, etc.  This is useful for interviews as well as performance reviews and aiming for a promotion/raise. 
- being slow is not necessarily a bad thing. Every company thinks they’re fast paced, even when they’re not. If you’re “slow”, avoid small startups, but not necessarily large startups. 
- it takes time to learn the sheer minimum breadth and depth of topics to grow as an engineer. Personal note, I compare myself and my growth to other engineers often, and as they say, comparison is the thief of joy. You shouldn’t use others as a benchmark for your own growth. 
- taking care of your mental health is always important, but especially for anxiety with interviews or depression with rejections. Consider talking to a therapist, career coach, or something similar.

This is exactly why we have the daily exercises in this form. We're preparing them for the real job.

In our case, we don't believe in the firehose technique, and after meeting with hundreds of students post bootcamp, it doesn't seem to be working for many people. A lot of them are lost without React. They are memorizing instead of deeply learning.

I think that in-person intensives are perfect for some people, and other people have jobs and want to learn part-time. For now, we're filling that part-time niche. We'll have to let the students speak for themselves as far as how the daily drip of concepts and exercises work.

I need to know you’re going to teach me the hard stuff and you’re going to do it well. And having said that, i would further scrutinize the bootcamp due to its apparent lack of information on job placement and salary. I also find the text problematic as so many people have pointed out. 

Additionally, being female, the biological clock is ticking for me which is why I chose a bootcamp that didn’t stretch things out to 9 months of what you call a “slow drip of information” (also, yikes. There are better ways to market this!). It’s not even the money I care about. This just sounds like a huge time investment for not a lot of proven success. And time is of the essence for me.

Finally, the website just lacks maturity. The website signals to me what the course will be like - something you don’t take seriously and full of filler material. Being a minority woman means I’m under extra scrutiny so I need a bootcamp that takes itself more seriously or be more direct.

I'll be fully transparent, this immediately came off to me as only accessible to a *certain class of women*. Ones with a Mac, 9 months free, AND $10,000 to invest in a **possibility** (which I'm pointing out because the site has no stats or info on job placement). It feels like a different type of....gatekeeping almost, though I'm sure that's not your intention. I'm a Black queer woman who has worked in a couple of male-dominant industries. I've looked at a lot of programs in tech and music (back in college) that say ""WOMEN"" when they mean ""some women"", again even without that intention. To put it bluntly, I'd say go check the statistics for women in tech, then check again for Black women, or other minority groups. It's lower, and a huge reason why is opportunity vs gamble. In my opinion, bootcamps are already a gamble, but if I stumbled across the site in a search for one, I'd close it quickly for the reasons others have brought up as well.   

I think you've gotten a lot of great feedback, but the site/program here needs a bit of an overhaul to achieve what you've said you're hoping for. I'd love to see you bring another woman/minority focused tech program into the mix soon in the future though.

I'm a woman and a software engineer, but I also already finished my degree and never really looked into bootcamps. That being said, my thoughts:

I've looked through your bootcamp website and I noticed a couple things that were kind of off-putting if I was someone considering spending $10k.

For one, I understand that the vibe your website is going for is ""playful"", but at times it felt kind of ... snarky, and detracted from the professionalism of your program. E.g.

> Students are accepted based on personality and enthusiasm. *If you’re a jerk*, or you’re *boring*, It’s not in our best interest for you to become a designer: **because** WE will have to use the things you design.

I can tell you that this pitch is entirely unappealing to me, especially with all the formatting inflections (italics/bolding). It's needlessly aggressive and assumes the worst about me, an applicant demographic who may already be unsure about my place in this industry. You can have high standards for who you accept into your program, but it's more inviting if you state them as positives instead of guarding against negatives.

There were other things too that made me question the polish of your program, for example under one video it says:

> Time is your most valuable asset. {{this video is out of date}}

It definitely gives off the vibe that your website (and by extension the program itself) are still under construction, and makes me question whether the $10k price tag is warranted if the product isn't finished yet. 

Next, your ""apply now"" page honestly fills me with social anxiety:

> You don’t want to be one of those people who get on a call with us and haven’t read about the school or watched any of the videos.

-

> _If_ you understand what we’re doing and you think you’d be a good fit, you can meet us on a Zoom call

-

> If we aren’t a match, we will know because things will feel _weird_.

It feels condescending. These things are all common sense -- come to an interview prepared, hope for good vibes -- but to have them stated so plainly as negatives, almost like you're expecting me to fail at preparing and understanding the point of your program, is a deterrent for me. Is this how the instructors would treat me too? ""_If_ you think you understand this, be prepared to be proven wrong..."" :(

Also, like someone else mentioned, nowhere is there any mention of scholarships for gender minorities. There is no FAQ page about payment plans or programs, or DEI statement linked in the footer of the page.

I appreciate this feedback.

I just realized that even though it is deleted, it will let me write here. We though we were helping let the student off the hook. As in if *they* felt like it was a bad fit then we were not going to try and high-pressure sales them into anything. Many of our past students have gone through many different funnels like career karma before they get to us and we want to make sure that they know it's just an open conversation to see if their goals align with what we're teaching and how we're teaching it.

As far as polish, we would agree. But we are just more excited about the things the students are doing. We threw up that site in a few days - and things just started and we haven't had time to deal with it since. But thank you for your feedback. We talk to people about scholarship options based on what we discuss when we meet. That needs to be covered in a more personal conversation. We've never turned anyone down based on money. Which I'll say here since this thread is basically private now. \[\[EDIT: Apparently this has been retroactively *not* deleted by mods? OK. Weird\]\]  Everything is tricky these days. The word ""Scholarship"" can bother people, being given something can be seen as something being taken away from someone else. It's tricky. Which is partially why I made this post. And it has revealed a lot of great information. We work out pricing plans on a sliding scale based on the person and their needs. We're either bad *people* \- or bad *business people* either way you look at it.

""You don’t want to be one of those people who get on a call with us and haven’t read about the school or watched any of the videos."" We didn't consider that this might sound condescending, but more of a playful/helpful reminder to prepare their questions. We had so many people coming to the meetings who seemed like they had no real interest in the industry. This will be fixed when we start giving out a practice project to apply. But thanks for telling us about that.

""You can have high standards for who you accept into your program, but it's more inviting if you state them as positives instead of guarding against negatives"" - this is helpful. I posted this just before our new website is finished. The new copy is much more about explaining why (not for us) (but for student success) people need to be really enthusiastic about the medium and not just loosely interested in tech. I can't go into that here, but for the student's sake, they need to know that this only works if they meet us halfway. They need to have high standards for themselves in order to succeed in this field. I think that most teachers would agree about that in general. We're just not explaining it very well yet.

- accreditation: my bootcamp is recognize by two major colleges in the area and completing it can put you 15 credits into a degree.
- credibility: they're not only working with the state on a close level to get and stay credible, all of the people are engineers who have actually worked in the industry from the bottom up. 
- job security: they work post bootcamp to help get people tied to jobs 
- other outreaches- they started helping teach underprivileged children to code, then high-schoolers, now they work with adults. they're expanding to another state.
- an emphasis on humans: they have info on everyone in their organization from the ground up on the website, pics of previous students, pics of their building- you name it.

- a lot of very long, drawn out and bad UX/UI. ditch highlighting, ditch emojis and cut out the bs if you want me to take you seriously. I'm a serious person who seriously wants to code  and quit a full-time, serious job to do so. your website is your first impression to me, and I don't trust you to teach me seriously based on it. 
- I also graduated in English. reading a 3 paragraphs that can be summarized in 1 sentence makes you feel incompetent at communication.
- no sense that you are reliable or have any accreditations. 
- no indication that you are real people: who are your instructors? what's their education? where are your graduates? it's your responsibility to provide this. Do it mainly with photos, not videos. Your videos are too long and ramble on. That's not bad if you're a YouTube streamer, but it's not good if you're trying to attract prospective students and just confusing them more.
- confusing design-  It seems less like a site and more like a blog post on Tumblr. **Why would I go to you to learn to make websites if you can't make a website that looks polished and runs smooth as butter?**
- no schedule at all of anything.  give dates for cohorts, give times making note of the timezone you're in, if you're looking to do this online
- overall, a very patronizing tone. You need to understand that if you're trying to convince beginners to enter this that it's scary and every ""we don't accept everyone"" statement or ""not reading about us would be a big red flag"" - that turns people away. You sound almost like an MLM with the ""we're not like the other guys"" approach. the language you use all throughout things is trying to break things down (I think)  just is vague and confusing to people looking to learn baby's first Javascript.  
- you have to have a Mac. do you really? doesn't seem very accessible and there are sites you can easily use for free to provide coding environments where a Mac wouldn't be necessary. to me again, this speaks to incompetence. you're also drastically slashing your cohort, you'd instantly lose a lot of people who are naturally into computers because most power users tend to run PCs. 
- what is the focus? no, everything is not a good answer. I choose to do a bootcamp that was for fullstack web development because it was clear what I would learn and wouldn't, and the skills they teach me will help me to go on and learn any other number of languages, frameworks, etc in the future. You need a focus and some form of direction to avoid stressing out students and yourself.

other things to think on:

what do you offer that others don't? what is the science behind learning that guides you. what is your philosophy? what great depth of life and professional experience do you have to draw from to support people from their first code to first job?

Thankfully I managed to switch teams on decent terms and now I like my manager and my career promptly skyrocketed so I’m no longer trying to leave. 

On the other team, the guy in charge was all tech, no lead, and barely tech if I’m being honest. Every ticket was a random menial task with no context, minor tweaks with no underlying or apparent reason, fundamentally flawed “experiments” that any informed person would know are doomed to fail. The lead was 100% in his whole head and off the rails; never used his resources to refine or question his ideas, never even made much of an effort to make sure his ideas could actually be put to use in the actual product. No road map, no major goals, just endlessly hammering out whatever Whim of the Week he came up that would promptly whither into oblivion since there was no use for the feature anyway. So much wasted time. 

There were plenty of interesting and challenging projects that our team should have been fit to handle, but the lead either did all the major “intellectual” work himself and passed off the remaining grunt work to the people below him, or if he didn’t know how to solve it himself he would bounce the project to another team without even discussing it with anybody! So infuriating. 

As a people manager he was basically completely absent. I was trying to grow and learn, and for MONTHS I consistently begged him to give me more impactful and interesting projects but he would just tell me the last thing I did WAS interesting and I’m doing fine, don’t worry, just keep doing what I’m doing. He didn’t seem to believe me that I was quite capable and very, very bored. I thought he was just a “bad people manager” until we hired a white boy as an intern, intern became his beloved mini-me and got all the interesting stuff while the rest of us sat there looking incompetent because he literally wouldn’t give us useful shit to do. Suddenly I realized we weren’t getting interesting projects because we didn’t look like him. Then in meetings he’d mock us with praise for the most brain-dead tasks as if we’d surpassed his expectations for us. It was so utterly demoralizing, and I started to feel like my brain was literally degenerating on the job, so I had to get out of there. 

I finally managed to switch teams (an ordeal of its own, ugh) and my productivity and skill level skyrocketed; I learned a bunch of new stuff, got to be involved in a lot of high-impact projects, and eventually I took a crack at one of the projects the old manager wouldn’t touch… and nailed it. Now it’s soon to become a staple in our system and I get to have meetings with the old manager about moving over from his thing to my thing.

Trying to start this conversation with firing 2 senior devs is a fantasy and it's painful to see how many comments suggest it.

I'm going to be honest, I didn't expect to have to treat the women on my team differently. I believed the other members of my team, as well as other teams and management would not or less treat women like anyone else on my team. My employer has a progressive EDI program, and a lot of woman leaders. I'll also add that the only reason I became fully aware of any issues is because the 2nd time it happened, the woman involved was a long time co-worker that I had specifically recruited. 

Back to the advice. Here's what I saw happening:

- Literally everyone cut her off. All the fucking time, no matter what she was talking about. I started keeping score. It was almost 7:1 compared to any other individual and 7:5 if all men were treated as a group. Holy shitbags. 

- She was automatically assigned project roles like ""meeting note taker"", coordinator, etc. If sandwich fetcher had been a thing, she'd have been assigned it. This was a team of 'progressive' dudes, it just kept happening. 

- She would be the last call for an opinion. Even on her own projects, or in her area of expertise.

Here's what I did (better or worse):

So, you have to be subtle. Being obvious reinforces negative attitudes about women in the workplace. 

- Be louder. When I saw someone being cut off, I'd cut them off and return the conversation to it's proper path. Sometimes you have to let someone go on for a bit, sometimes you have to be a little insulting about them cutting off others. 

- Work harder. I started making things like meeting note taker a revolving role. I spent more time working with project teams to level the field. 

- Show respect. Probably the biggest impact for me was deferring publicly to Katie's opinion or asking it in public settings. In fairness, I do that with all of my team now, but I feel that you have to highlight this for women on the team.

1. Email him, CC the department chair. Recap the conversation and the situation in class, and express why you found it inappropriate.

Sure, every department I've ever been in has had at least one husband/wife team on it, and it's possible they met in grad school, but that's also significantly older scientists than current grad student.

When I was in grad school between 08-16, mst grad students either came in relationships or dated outside of their department or the university in general. I maybe knew a few interdepartmental relationships, say physics/math or bio/sociology, but realistically I saw more arranged marriages than grad students dating grad students. So it feels like you're writing off a lot of the relationships grad students are having by focusing only on STEM/STEM or in department romance

I know in the past 10-15 years there's been a lot of research focusing on say astronomical rates of DV in teen relationships which has done a lot of good in tearing down DV as something that only happens to older, married women. And it's worth looking at if graduate or professional school is a time of higher vulnerabilty towards this sort of dynamic, but I think you risk erasing  a lot of people who may have had grad school and DV intersect temporally by assuming the situation is that a) women assume they're too smart to be abused and that b) the reason they trust their partners is because their partner is a colleague (as opposed to a more general no woman really expects to be victim of DV and generally trusts partners unless given reason not to or approaches partners in general with caution).

The long hours and intensive world of grad school may mean a heterosexual dating world skews towards colleagues, but do you think women, having accepted a date, trust someone from work more or less implicitly than say, a friend's roommate or brother, guy from a social group, or that they met some other way? Or are somehow more vulnerable to abuse from a colleague compared to a random partner from college/shared interests/etc?

Like if you're coupling men in grad school are more likely to be abusive because ego/stress/reasons with women in grad school are more vulnerable because the professional aspect gives them a false sense of security, it could make a sort of sense to hone in on intergrad student relationships. Otherwise, maybe the important thing is the stress and demands of grad school and how that impacts behavior of women in DV scenarios regardless of who their partner is/where they met.

For instance:

* Is it the financial angle: it's harder to leave when you make a 12k a year stipend, crappy insurance (or get it through your partner) and your PI won't give you time off to move (mimicking difficulties faced by women of lower SES)?
* Are in-university counseling services available to graduate students (most people I knew in therapy in grad school went to university services run by the psych program so grad student counsellors) not sufficient in recognizing / aiding in DV?
* Do the time demands of grad school contract social networks to the point grad students lack social safety nets, further isolating them from the support to leave?
* What about for international students who have even less of one intriniscally because their families are overseas?

So, what you’ve described doesn’t immediately scream “catty” or lacking respect or problematic to me. Sarcasm doesn’t have to be mean, it can be funny, getting people laughing together helps team dynamics.

First thing is try to understand intent. Does she intend to be mean, or is she trying to lighten the mood? 

If she seems unaware of the impact of her words on you, and it is a real problem for you, I would have a talk to her 1:1 to ask her why she makes those comments and let her know it makes you feel. This gives her an opportunity to learn, reflect and change her behaviour towards you.

If your team does sprint retros, this would be another place you could raise it so the whole team can discuss it and you can get multiple perspectives.

You could also consider: would you feel so badly about it if you were a participant in it, if you started making sarcastic jokes back to her? If it didn’t feel so one way?

I thought I could give you the view from the other side perhaps (Though I have rarely been in a class with more than 10 people, so will most likely not have the same experience as everyone else) 😅

When I was 11 til around 14, we had no girls in our class, in fact, there was only 1 girl on the whole floor where my class was located until we moved floors when I turned ~13. We didn't think much about it, we were just kids playing around back and forth. But when I turned 14, a girl joined our class. It was... Interesting. She was very bossy, and saw herself as the one in command of our class. We were about 8 people at the time, 2 of the guys in my class fell in love with her and did everything she asked for, the rest didn't really mind that much other than when she was lecturing them about things back and forth (which was often). I remember that I was laying in a sofa when she all of a sudden ran towards me and jumped on top of me and said ""I'm gonna pick your eyebrows!"". Her reasoning was that since I was a guy, I should be punished for the beauty standard forced upon her by other guys (no one in our class forced her to do anything, nor cared about it, but apparently we were still at fault for instagram models doing it, it was weird). She then decided to pick everyones eyebrows, and about half of the class gave in just to get it over with. She was bossy, and it was an interesting time 😂

When I got into highschool (15-19), we had 1 girl in class there as well. She was very shy, very silent, and sat alone most of the time. We tried our best to include her in our conversations etc, but she preferred to sit alone with her studies, so we respected that and tried to not disturb her. We would eventually work together making a company (It was an assignment to make a real company and sell products or services for about 6 months, so we did). Once that was done, she went back to studying in silence again. I hear nowdays she is working with advanced math and chemistry, so it seems things are going well for her 🙂

And that brings us to today. I started my DevOps Engineer education in 2021. We were a class of about ~35, and only ~4 of them were girls. Many people have dropped out, so we are about ~15-20 people, 3 of the 4 girls are still there, and they are doing great. The class works well, and we collaborate a lot! 😁


So what I am trying to say is that I might not have much experience, but from the experience I have, the girls have mostly been well integrated with the boys. Usually the shared interest helps you bond with the rest of the class. You shouldn't have to change to be able to feel like you can communicate with them, just talk with them, and share your interests! I'm sure they would love to have you in their group of friends and be open with you! :)

His question was “how was I supposed to know it wasn’t what I was supposed to be using??” But had he taken the time to understand the pieces and pipeline of our project, he would know not to use that.

He has the tendency to ask “What does this variable mean?”  And the next day he’ll ask what that same variable means and frustrate about why it’s even there and somehow make it seem like it’s my fault he can’t keep up. 

It’s getting exhausting dealing with his antics, and it makes me dread work. I answer his questions and clearly it goes one ear out the other.

My first programming role was a one year contract working remotely. My daughter at the time was four. On my second day of work my daughter's new daycare suddenly shut down due to a virus (not covid) so she had to stay home with me. I was trying to entertain her at home despite a full day of training meetings.

One of those meetings was with my new boss. My daughter had been so good up to that point, but in that most important meeting of the day she decided it was the opportune time to practice being a cat, including making LOUD cat noises. Because kids are weird. 

I'm trying to shush her with lots of under the desk hand signals while still smiling into zoom when my boss suddenly hears her and asks if I have a cat.

I panicked a bit. Trying to be sarcastic I said ""Yes, a really naughty one"". My boss laughed. And then started talking about his cats. About how much he loves his cats (like he REALLY loves cats). And that it's so great that we have something in common. And in that moment I realized I had very much messed up.

For the rest of that year long contract my boss would ask me about my cat almost every week. And I would answer something vague about my daughter that i thought maybe would also apply to cats (""she's leaving her toys everywhere, it's driving me mad"").

Then 15 minutes later, two guys a row in front of us were visibly laughing about something not related to the class, and the prof said, ""Hey man, I appreciate you trying to help out your friend, but could you keep it down?"" My jaw was literally on the floor, but me and the girl became great friends after that from our joint hatred of that prof lol.

I am a female grad student in engineering. I was wondering if anyone has any tips for dealing with men frequently hitting on you in an annoying/inappropriate way.

For example, I was out on Friday with a group of my friends. Someone introduced me to this guy who is a visiting scholar here and apparently he works in my building. He told me he's ""seen me around a lot"" (which I found kind of creepy to say) and kept trying to talk to me all night/obviously was interested in me. My response in these situations is usually to just be polite even if they're annoying me. Or I try to walk away and go to a different part of the venue, but often they will eventually follow me. I don't know how to shut down these guys and get them to just leave me alone.

I feel like if we worked at the same company/department, guys wouldn't feel as comfortable acting like this (maybe I'm wrong.) Like if you hit on women in your company, it could be deemed unprofessional or someone could make a complaint HR. But I feel like in school, guys view it as a more informal setting or something and it makes them feel like it's ok to act like this.

This has happened to me before on campus as well (not just out on a Friday), and in undergrad a lot. A lot of the time it's guys in my major or in my building, which makes it harder for me to be assertive since I know I will have to see them around again eventually. Like that guy works in my building, so I'd rather not be overly rude to him.

I'm sure you guys have dealt with stuff like this before, so any tips?",1554,testimonial injustice,hi guy female grad student engineering wonder anyone tip deal men frequently hit annoy inappropriate way example friday group friends someone introduce guy visit scholar apparently work building tell see around lot find kind creepy say kept try talk night obviously interested response situation usually polite even annoy try walk away go different part venue often eventually follow know shut guy get leave alone feel like work company department guy feel comfortable act like maybe wrong like hit woman company could deem unprofessional someone could make complaint hr feel like school guy view informal set something make feel like ok act like happen campus well friday undergrad lot lot time guy major build make hard assertive since know see around eventually like guy work build rather overly rude sure guy deal stuff like tip,"advice, tech, need, work, feel",0.7155574266490542,"rude, domineering, dismissive, ostracism, disrespectful",0.5199999999999999,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.6551121767745364

First, I give him a chance to take the hint. I am cordial but avoid conversations with him, don't encourage any flirting or conversation he starts, find an excuse to leave interactions as soon as possible, and (if I can get away with it) mention a fake boyfriend. A real one works too if you have one, of course.

If he's still oblivious after this, I go for polite but direct. I usually use this one after he's given a very clear sign of flirting, like asking me out or trying to go in for a kiss. Usually my line is something like ""I'm flattered but I'm not interested in you like that"" or ""That's very sweet but I'm seeing someone else right now"". Something that doesn't make the blow land too hard, but is also very clear. 

If he doesn't listen to that, you get to be a bitch. Get creative. Be sarcastic. Clearly he won't listen to you when you're being nice, so it's time to be a lot less nice.
""NO, I told you I don't like that/don't want you to do that."" 
""I told you I'm not interested, how many times do I have to make that clear before you'll listen?"" 
""Buddy you need to back off because I already said it ain't happening."" 
If he's pushy enough to not listen to you, then call you a bitch for being super assertive, take it as a compliment - all it means is that he's frustrated that you aren't a pushover.

In my experience things very rarely escalate to step 3, and a lot of guys will already get it if you just make a point to avoid interacting with them.

xxstem,hot,2023-10-25 0:02,2018-05-07 16:46,supershinythings,Comment,How to deal with men hitting on me in school?,dylsrjh,,"This happened to me occasionally in grad school.  I was once followed out to my car by some lab assistant who DEMANDED my phone number.  I tried to be polite turning him down, but he simply insisted over and over again.  Finally I gave him a wrong number, which of course he later called.  When he angrily confronted me I angrily responded that I said NO like 5 times, and he was being really pushy, so if he wanted to make a thing of it we could go down to the Dean's office and discuss this further.  He backed off.  After that he was of course a dick to me, but that's OK.  I didn't need his kind of 'help' anyway.

As I've gotten older I've perfected a 'stare' look.  When they ask inappropriate questions or try to get too close, I stare at them for a good long time.  I don't say anything, I just stare.  Then, once things get uncomfortable, I change the subject to something work-related.  If they persist, they get the 'stare' again.  The 'stare' should not include any friendliness to it - it should be like you're staring at a dog turd on your doorstep - you're a little disgusted, a little annoyed, everything smells like shit, and really don't want to talk.  Walk away if you can, and don't break eye-contact until you're away enough.  They need to know you're not afraid of them, you're disgusted with them.  

Some people from certain cultures will be super-pushy and this won't work, but most will be OK.  For the super-pushy, you have to get rude, and do it quickly.  Don't let them think that you're 'playing', or 'flirting'.  In their culture, it's YOUR fault they're attracted to you.  So it may be necessary to talk to the Dean about this cultural difference, because they're not comprehending how offensive they're being. 

You may need to talk to a female from that country to find out what THEY do; they may have better ideas.  And if they don't, then you'll likely need to talk to either the Dean's office or Campus Police to give them an orientation about what is and is not appropriate where you are.  What you do NOT want is for them to claim that you 'led them on' because you looked in their general direction or wore something cute, which to them means they get an automatic pass into your pants.

Otherwise, I just stare and walk away or change the subject.  They'll smile, laugh, cajole, try to be charming, but you're not into it.  Look at them like they're a dog turd, imagine it, get that disgusted look, and walk away or change the subject.

If you think they can handle it, you can say, ""I don't think that's appropriate.  Let's try this again.""  Then start the conversation over from the beginning, and when it gets inappropriate, stop and say, ""right there, that's not going to work.  How about..."" And suggest something that isn't a come-on, like something work-related.  These guys are young, and may or may not think you're playing.  Unfortunately YOU are the one who has to be the adult in the room, because they still think they can do stupid shit and pretend they're just ""Joking"".  Well, you are not 'joking'.  You're just trying to get work done. 

 If it's clear they can't behave appropriately, you need to segment them into those you can be yourself around, and those you can't, because they'll behave inappropriately then backpedal to 'joking' when you stop them.  Naturally they will say stupid shit about you to your back.  But if you can establish and maintain clear boundaries, at least you can say you're doing your part.

For many guys it's a 'game'.  They push and push and push until they get somewhere.  They give each other shit when they fail, and they cheer each other on when they're able to get somewhere - then of course the target is marked as 'easy' or a 'slut' or whatever.  

They look for weak points - are you sensitive to name-calling?  That's what may work with you, so they'll do that.  Don't like comments about your appearance?  They'll do this all day long.  Feel insecure about your looks?  They'll pick this up and 'neg' you until they get somewhere.  Does flattery work?  Awesome.  They're there.  They're 'playing', testing, to see what works on you.  You, OTOH, don't really get any information on what works on them.  So you only have a few options, most of which are nuclear.

It's just a game, a joke, to them.  And you don't get to look for weak points because they'll just escalate.  It's a vicious little game they play.  To play this game back, unfortunately you have to separate yourself emotionally from the threat you're feeling and realize that they're playing this game.  This is incredibly hard to do, because your mind is NOT in that space when you're interacting - they're taking work-related conversations and trying to subvert them to serve their own selfish inappropiate agenda.  Your need to catch this and redirect it back.  This requires awareness and some pre-planning.

Realize that they're not emotionally impacted by their own behavior.   But to us, it's a very real threat to our physical and emotional sovereignty.

A good manager wouldn’t scoff about bringing another person along, especially not in front of them. If there was a reason not to bring them, they would communicate that in reasonable terms. “I need someone who is more experienced with x, knows about y, and we don’t have the budget to bring the OP as well as theColleague”. Nothing in what he said gave any real reason. It wasn’t about taking OP instead of the colleague, but taking her as well. And if she isn’t considered as good as the colleague, then it would be a great learning experience for her, and managers should be providing opportunities for professional development experiences like this.

It’s gaslighting to tell a person that there is nothing wrong when actually there is.

You can be on an innocuous subreddit that’s for sharing pictures of tiny flowers and it can end up being really toxic. All you can do is unsubscribe from the toxic ones and keep looking for ones with good vibes. It sucks to leave a good subreddit, but sometimes it’s the only way to preserve your mental well-being.

A while back made a post about needed alternate transportation due to a back injury (not taking a train) and half the responses were “take the train” and a good number were “you won’t find anything within your budget that isn’t a train”. My post said nothing about any budget or trying to find a cheap option. So reading comprehension or even bothering to read at all is, sadly, quite common. I was upset for the first few hours and tried to re-explain that I was inexperienced with other options and wanted input, but then it became impossible for me to respond to everyone and then it became comical that despite 20+ people already saying “take the train” more people needed to make that same statement instead of upvoting a previous poster and moving on.

Yesterday, I posted in a back pain subreddit how I am really struggling with the emotional aspect of it and having a really hard day and there were no less than 3 posts about how I needed to lose weight (though my post had no mention of weight). Then some even edited their post blaming me for the downvotes. I don’t know how hard is it to understand for some people that if someone says “I am having a bad day” That “you should lose weight” is always going to make the top 10 worst responses possible and it wasn’t even me who downvoted them.

I used to participate in some coding subreddits but there was a 50/50 chance I would be downvoted (just once or twice) or frustrated to see someone else’s almost word for word same answer posted hours after mine get all the upvotes. I would obsessively reread what I wrote to see if I wrote something wrong. Until I realized if I am going to post things I have to reduce my caring or just stop engaging if I can’t stop caring.

I used to think I needed to try harder or list some credentials. But after those two non-coding related posts I realized that there is an aspect to Reddit where you can’t inoculate yourself from people’s … freedom of expression, no matter how hard you try.

Some background before I get into the main issue. My manager, Tom, has been with the company about one year longer than myself, I've been here for a little over a decade. He has a close personal relationship with the VP, Andrew, who is also head of HR. Tom has always had fairly major personnel issues. For example, he would frequently go on drinking binges and not show up for work or to important meetings or presentations. Tom is the project manager and naturally is responsible for communicating new project specs to the engineers but he does not do this. He will only deliver bare minimum information and if you ask questions about the project he will either respond that he is too busy or if he does decide to engage he will do so angrily and condescendingly. He frequuently tells other co-workers they are stupid, incapable of doing their job etc. if they ask a question. He also gatekeeps information constantly; information which is required to finish a project. For example our team sometimes has to work with third-party software. He insisted on developing the interface between our software and the third-party software. He refuses to provide any documentation on how it works so that we can troubleshoot it effectively should we come across an issue. Many people have complained about his behavior and spoken to Andrew about it on multiple occassions. Onto the issue at hand!

&#x200B;

I was recently given a project that had to utilize the interface system he built for third-party software. Out of the box what he developed failed to work; he insisted that his interface was 'plug and play' and only a few items needed to be configured prior to use, which I had done. I then spent the next four hours auditing and documenting everything he did and fixing it to make it work. I should note that I did attempt to contact him and explain the errors I was seeing but he shut me down and wouldn't give me any additional information. Tom was recently out of the office and one piece of the interface still wasn't working; I already troubleshooted what I had access to prior but this of course did not resolve the issue. I reached out to the client to double-check that I had all of the correct server info. and they routed me to their support person for the third party software. They confirmed nothing was wrong on their end and suggested that I reach out to Tom since he is our internal contact for the third party software. I explained that Tom was out on vacation and we were trying to troubleshoot it in his absence but would ask him upon his return, Tom was cc'ed on all of this. At this point I had about two weeks of work and customization which I'd done for the project.

&#x200B;

Tom returns from vacation but ignores the email so I send a follow-up. I explained everything I had done so far and asked that he take a look or let me know what else I can do to resolve the issue. He responds via email to say that nothing is wrong with the interface and he just ran a test and everything works. This is when I login to the server and see him working on the project. Red flag number one, he went in and made changes to the interface to resolve the issue, instead of telling me this he effectively gaslights me and tells me it always worked and there are no issues. I then run another test and it still fails, in addition I notice I'm getting tons of other errors. This is when I come to find that he's deleted every single thing I'd worked on from the past two weeks and replaced it with something else. He backed up nothing before doing this, in addition it seems the backups I had made of my own work are missing.

Before I realized he had deleted and replaced everything I sent a reply email to let him know that the interface was still throwing the same error along with some additional errors. I noted that I didn't understand why it would start generating new errors when I'd made no new changes to the interface this morning. He ignored my email and has yet to communicate what he did. He has made changes/deleted small pieces of projects before like this but not to this scale. 

A small group of my co-workers and I will be meeting later this afternoon to discuss the issues with Tom. His behavior has only escalated and continues to get worse with no repercussion or assistance from upper management (Andrew). I need advice on how we can best handle this situation with HR/upper management since it's obvious that Andrew will not do anything to resolve this situation because of his relationship with Tom. The only other person that might be able to assist in this situation is the sales manager; he has expressed his dislike and issues with Tom multiple times and as I understand it has also tried to report him to Andrew. At this point he hasn't been included in our group discussions but I don't know if it would be a good idea at this point to do so.

A meritocracy cannot truly exist until the people being judged on merit are being judged fairly, and have come from reasonably equal beginnings.

There are many unconscious biases that women face just for being women.

There are several studies that show a piece of work will be considered less valuable if people believe it to be the work of a woman.

Women who join predominantly male industries are far more likely to leave due to the fact that they will be vulnerable to sexual assault lower pay, and discrimination socially and professionally.

As for your claim that women aren't as passionate about tech... I challenge that claim, plenty of women are passionate about tech but deal with a lot of bulshit and slowly burnout.

You seem to believe that only men can be passionate and nerdy when it comes to technology and that's because it's been marketed to you that way through the media. Because women in the media are generally only there as a plot device for men, or to be sexualized in general. Nerdy techy girls are not generally considered hot, therefore never get any screen time, unless it's to be the butt of a joke.

The irony is that computer work, specifically programming used to be seen as predominantly secretarial work, meaning ""women's work."" When the technology industry stopped appearing this way to men, women were quickly shoved out of the industry, where previously there had been a nearly 50/50 split between men and women in the industry it was now predominantly men with almost no women in an industry.

I am a woman who has been in tech for 13 years I studied technology and dropped out due to sexual assault being stalked by a fellow classmate and having my work ""lost"" or told it was sub-par because I refuse to date the tutor.

Yes I persevered through this, but I shouldn't have had to?
I don't think anyone could blame me for not wanting to, how could you blame anyone for not wanting to go through that?

Had there been other women around me I wouldn't have felt so isolated and alone and likely would have been able to stand up for myself knowing there would be a group of people who would know how I felt and support me, you may think that men can do this for women and perhaps they can, but they very rarely do.

Instead I failed the class and worked my way up in the i.t. industry another way.

As a man in technology you will never have anyone doubt your work based on your gender, you will never have anybody isolate you because of your gender... 

When you are assertive you will be seen as a leader, when women are assertive we are seen as pushy, or bossy, or nagging. If you ever so choose to have a family it will have a positive impact on your career statistically, if a woman chooses to have a family it will statistically have a negative effect on her career. 

Until such a time these gaps in equality are addressed I think it is completely necessary to have programs such as scholarships in order to encourage more women in the industry and balance the unfairness that currently exists in favour of men.

And last but not least, don't think that, that one sentence you said about dispassionate men even came close to the massive rant you made about women and how horrible you think they are, and how undeserving you think they are.

The field is extremely hostile to women on all fronts which is sad cause it’s hella fun. 

Want more women in tech? Step one- paternity leave. Normalize it. Babies are demanding round the clock bosses. It’s not a break. Companies need to have temporary employees while the parent (not just mom) is out. Expecting work to be done on leave is nuts. Blaming only women for having kids is wild. Step two- Have people close their eyes and imagine an IT person or someone who codes. 99% they’re imagining white or Asian and male. They want to hear a male voice tell them what to do.

For myself, I grew up in very cisessentialist environments - smart boys are just better at certain kinds of creative, problem-solving activities and ""thinking"". Smart girls follow rules and instructions when told to and stay out of the way otherwise. 

The results in - not asking questions, not seeing yourself in certain roles, not feeling ""allowed"" to experiment or peek, not wanting attention, etc. 

This is not just a gender issue - many cultures teach their kids that this is the way to act in Western/white workplaces. But these barriers get in the way of effective problem solving. 

As for what your company can do:

Form long-term mentorship relationships with young people. There are plenty of summer and after-school coding programs but the rate at which kids leave coding is still pretty high. They'll likely have other barriers like family not understanding their passion or needs (focus time, effort that doesn't result in grades, electricity, etc), insufficient basic education (reading comprehension, arithmetic, reasoning skills), emotion regulation when faced with new scary things or imposter syndrome, etc. This way, you'll be able to influence the attrition rate before college (declaring majors).

If you want to retain the diverse talent you already have:

Train your employees to learn about the ways systems of oppression affect individuals and how that can show in different behaviors. At minimum, train your employees to realize there are consequences for being unwilling to learn.

Train people to recognize when discrimination occurs, even when it is legal and even when people are doing and saying all the right things. Too many times, allies have stood by and told me I was imagining things, only to be shocked when things became definitively illegal harassment or retaliation. 

Conversely, I was so used to giving people chances that there were a few times when allies with less institutional power took me aside to tell me I was being treated unfairly and I didn't recognize it because everyone else sounded like they were saying and doing the right things. It took me a long time to realize the rubric I was being assessed with was not the same as the rubric for everyone else.

Because tech is still seen as a 'passion' field. And nobody cares about training, everything is just 'teach yourself'. I got my first computer at 16, I didn't even know CS degrees existed and after uni I fell into a technical role by accident but every single day I feel I don't belong here. It's nothing to do with my team, they're all amazing and supportive despite me being the only woman, and the youngest.

\- Everybody's story is 'I started coding when I was 10 blah'

\- Constant talk about video games, some new technical thing, nobody really discusses normal topics.

\- No training, you're expected to 'learn everything' by yourself unpaid and everyone around you already knows what they're doing because they spent 20+ hours tinkering on the weekends.

Now these things in isolation are fine! In fact from an unconventional background I wouldn't have made it without my weekend work, as we speak I'm keeping an eye on my pipelines. But the general MESSAGING is that tech is a thing only for those obsessed with it who 'fit the mould'. You can't be here because you're reasonable good at it , want to make decent money and generally want to go home at 5, live your life. IMO those who WANT to surge ahead, fine, but constant grinding to the detriment of everything else shouldn't be an industry norm.

I do a lot of outreach events, for interns/grads etc the majority of women even those who do CS/Engineering end up going into PM, tech recruiting or similar roles after a couple of years in the job because of this. It's hard to battle the imposter syndrome. FWIW I genuinely love all of this, if I wasn't tinkering around I'd just be reading books so it's not like I'm sacrificing a brilliant social life. But I'm starting to question whether it's worth it. Especially after kids somehow the mental load always falls to the woman anyway you get further and further behind.

If you want to attract more women (or anybody who's unconventional really) - the main thing you should highlight is your support for technical pathways. Training people at work time costs the company, as opposed to just hiring those who will happily put in huge amounts of time at home. Companies already short on devs expect new hires to be productive. By contrast nobody would ever let a junior doctor loose on patients, or a junior accountant loose on financial statement production without a lot of handholding.

Also if it's female technical staff you're after make sure you highlight them. I've lost count r.e. the number of times I've turned up to D&I events and every 'woman in tech' was a project manager, HR staff, or similar. It's like being an accountant for a tech firm and saying you 'work in tech' erm no admin/support roles have mainly been women...",2829,testimonial injustice,nb restrict woman passion people men anyway tech still see passion field nobody care train everything teach get first computer 16 even know c degree exist uni fell technical role accident every single day feel belong nothing team amaze supportive despite woman young everybody story start cod 10 blah constant talk video game new technical thing nobody really discuss normal topic train expect learn everything unpaid everyone around already know spent 20 hour tinker weekend thing isolation fine fact unconventional background make without weekend work speak keep eye pipeline general message tech thing obsessed fit mould reasonable good want make decent money generally want go home 5 live life imo want surge ahead fine constant grinding detriment everything else industry norm lot outreach event interns grad etc majority woman even cs engineering end go pm tech recruit similar role couple year job hard battle imposter syndrome fwiw genuinely love tinker around read book like sacrifice brilliant social life start question whether worth especially kid somehow mental load always fall woman anyway get behind want attract woman anybody unconventional really main thing highlight support technical pathway train people work time cost company oppose hire happily put huge amount time home company already short devs expect new hire productive contrast nobody would ever let junior doctor loose patient junior accountant loose financial statement production without lot handholding also female technical staff make sure highlight lose count r e number time turn event every woman tech project manager hr staff similar like accountant tech firm say work tech erm admin support roles mainly woman,"woman, job, tech, developer, software",0.6900768632577228,"manipulate, isolation, reprimand, discounting, inexperienced",0.5199999999999997,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.5505463017244588

I grew up without a father, so I was oblivious to the gender split in IT when I was a kid (oblivious to gender roles in general). I was into horses and was - naturally - on a horse website where the way you made profiles... was by typing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript lmao. Such an old website. I obviously wanted a cool profile - that's how I got into learning these three languages. Loved how getting things to work was like solving puzzles and mysteries. Then I got into PHP, SQL, from there on python, etc. Creating stuff gave me a dopamine rush like nothing else.

After a few years, I slowly started noticing how talking passionately about my programming hobby was *not* getting the same reaction like talking about my horse riding hobby. I started not talking about it at all. I made a programming friend online, that ended pretty soon after he made the ""do you know how to make a sandwich"" joke. Every girl I talked to got their computer fixed by their dad and barely knew what a browser was.

I tried getting into multiplayer online gaming as well, but quickly restricted myself to playing solo games. I told myself I just like solitary activities, but the truth was, I hated how gamers talked about women. I hated the avatars. I started hating being a woman.

In high school, I hated how all my programming friends eventually wanted something romantic when I did not. I hated how even when they didn't say anything insulting, I felt like an outsider. Like an imposter. Even if people are nice to you, it's uncomfortable being the only one of a type, be it gender, colour, diagnosis, whatever.

So I went into biomedicine. I'll tell you what, I fucking hated biomedicine. Here I am, graduated after five years, in a - guess what - programming job. Can't run from what you love, I guess. I like the work, but I lost a lot of experience the last five years compared to computer science students, and I still feel like the odd one out.

So in short, I 100% believe it's society that kills women's entry into computer science. All the guys talking about ""how women maybe just naturally aren't interested in this stuff"" are stupid. Remove girls from any form of gender split environment, and they'll 100% have an interest. Kids imitate the people around them, especially adults. If no women are going into computer science, who are they going to imitate, who are they going to look up to and follow? If dad is the handyman, why should they pick up any sign they should follow when mom is clueless? Who wants to go into a field where you know you're gonna be the odd one out, and where you feel an invisible resistance before even starting? Social pressure is at its peak at the age you have to pick a major.

Are there even enough women interested in your kinda work? 20 years ago (i live in switzerland) they tried their hardest to get women into tech-support and IT-based jobs over here.

&#x200B;

They basically tried to push every girl to do some technical work. Even if they didn't really want it.

When these girls enrolled into their apprenticeships (instead of studying you have something called a ""Fachlehre"" in Switzerland where you basically are a paid trainee for 3-4 years, learning the job and studying at the same time. It's basically a paid for bachelor of science degree with practical experience, but i digress).

Even besides these efforts (and certain companies only employing women/girls) when i started my apprenticeship in 1999. There were 80 men. And 4 Women.

One year later there were 160 men and 20 women.

In general it ended up with a ratio of 10-15% women.

However.

The Drop-Out-Rate for men was about 10%. For women it was about 50%

They got pushed into jobs that they didn't even want to do and that they didn't like.

In the past 20 years, wherever i worked (and i worked in banks, pharmaceutical companies, ensurance companies etc.) there were ever hardly any female Techies. The ones that were there, were the best coworkers i could wish for.

Smart, Hard-Working. Way better workers than most men i worked with. But there were almost none to be found. When sending out job offers in the field. You receive 200 applications. 90-95% of the applications are men.

And employing more women just to fill a quota won't solve the underlying issue, that there are just not enough women in the field. At least not over here.

I don't know how it is in the US so i'd really like to learn more about it.

&#x200B;

Over here it's a very slow increase. Due to girls being taught early, that women and men can do engineering jobs or work in a daycare we slowly start to narrow the gender-gap. But when i was back in school girls still learned how to sew and boys learned how to do woodwork. And 30 years later this is the work environment i find myself in.

&#x200B;

The issue with women dropping completely out of the workforce is also an issue we currently discuss over here. Because society in general thinks a man should be working and a woman should be a mother, the women usually take care of the kids.

Also often only the man gets paid enough to support a family. (Hello Wage-Gap which is ALSO another issue by itself).

&#x200B;

Sorry, ADD-Brain, i get all over the place again. What i basically wanted to say is. IF the company really cared about changing the current situation by employing more women.

I (34f) quit my grocery retail job last year after 11 years working at a well known hip ""fun"" grocery store chain in the US. My partner is a software developer and got her bachelor's and masters in CS in India and has been working in the US on an H1 for 12 years. I was miserable in retail but didn't want to get my master's to work in my field (My bachelor's is in speech pathology) and she turned me on to the idea of learning to code, but couldn't answer the question of ""What languages, where to start, what programs/courses/certificates/bootcamps will get me in the door"". I started a few YouTube courses and couldn't follow them because I really need instruction, and she's not a great tutor because she just is a coder, she doesn't have to think about how to be a coder. (I understand that as a coder you have to be able to learn on your own but I have a mental block trying to watch a youtube video and need some initial instruction)

I was able to bridge the industry gap by getting a job in customer support for a software company that was marketed with ""Customer support is where everyone starts but you can go anywhere else from there, the sky is the limit."" I made it clear that I wanted to move into a technical role and that I wanted to start with QA. I talked to my manager a few months ago and the response was ""We can make that happen, there will just have to be an opening."" I asked what courses I could take to get there and she said I would take courses once I moved to QA. I felt pretty good about the conversation, then she changed the subject and told me she wanted me to take on more responsibility in a support role that is less technical than general support. I kept finding, replicating, and reporting bugs and now I get no response to those messages. I'm frustrated and went on LinkedIn and saw that my company has an opening in QA...I don't have the energy to push my way into a technical role in my current company. Men are developers, IT and QA, women are in support, sales, or project management.

So now I'm where everyone else is. What do I do now? Every reddit thread asking about bootcamps, certificates, or degrees in CS have the following answers:

1) A bachelor's in CS is useless, do a bootcamp and build a portfolio.

2) I'm a recruiter and when I see bootcamp I toss the resume, get a degree in CS.

3) Just self-teach and get a job (These are usually dudes who were most likely handed a job and the type that my partner has to mentor at work who don't want to do any work or put in any effort) 

And every thread is full of people who took each route and are unemployable. 

I don't know if I expect a more direct answer by asking for myself. With my partner's salary we can afford for me to leave my job and do a bootcamp, but it's an expensive risk if my resume will got tossed. I can get a second bachelor's in CS as much as that pains me, but again it's an expensive risk if I'm going to graduate and not get hired because I don't have development skills.

There are always 3 choices you can make in any difficult professional relationship:

1. Talk to them about why you're feeling down about your relationship right now to give them a chance to explain/make good the situation.
2. Decide to step away from that relationship or lessen your contact with them - being ok that the relationship might never heal (which is also a totally valid option)
3. Do nothing about it and continue being stuck in an awful situation (sounds like you are not choosing this option which is great!)

It shows a lot of compassion that you're able to see that life is difficult for your mentor right now, despite her acting strangely around you. You must now decide whether the mentorship she's able to give you is worth the discomfort of opening up or not.

Within the past couple of years, she's made some increasingly problematic and mean comments. It used to just be about my disabilities (they were made up, they didn't influence thing x, they just meant I didn't know how to adult, they weren't actually a problem, etc.).  I tried to be patient with her, but the comments really bothered me because of how much discrimination I face daily in research.  Lately, it's really ramped up, though.  She's very volatile and explosive.  Very benign things will be met with very snotty answers.

I can't even ask her questions about grad school admissions without her making rude comments. They got so bad, I started low-key forwarding them to my therapist, and even she was shocked. Some of the emails and twitter messages I get and just verbally abusive. I can't draw boundaries or ask her to be nicer, or I'll be met with insults. 

She used to be a pretty good mentor to me. I know she has a lot on her plate with two kids, and another one on the way.  I'm very torn. On the one hand, I believe in keeping mentors in some capacity, for as long as you can. I don't like to throw relationships away. On the other hand, the comments seem to be getting increasingly aggressive, without provocation. The response doesn't ever seem to fit the situation, and she's getting downright mean.

Have you ever had to step away from a mentor that you've had for a while? How did you handle it?

I'm honestly super confused by the behavior, because she used to spend a lot of time talking to me about toxic mentorship-but she's started engaging in that kind of behavior. And the way she treats students with disabilities is really disappointing to me.  She's usually such an advocate for minority students (at least, on Twitter, she seems to be). I don't understand what happened or what would prompt the kind of behavior I'm getting.  It's hard to navigate, because I feel like I just kind of have to be her punching bag, or she'll go *off.*

[Chart and discussion here](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2015/01/10/chart-of-the-week-what-happened-to-women-in-computer-science/)

The short of it is that back when it was mechanical adding machines and slide rules ""computing"" was designated as women's work, because it's kinda secretarial, I dunno I guess.  

When programmable computing machines started to become important for engineering work, programming and operating them fell to women.  But home computers were marketed heavily as a father-son activity (many early ones were built from kits, like kit radios) and this lead to more young men going to school with some awareness of BASIC and assembly.  Then because sexism and laziness, schools confused prior experience with ability and didn't bother to accommodate novices.  So when the web bubble happened, it was mostly men getting rich.  A locker-room culture of acceptable sexual harassment emerged.  The gamer-to-tech pipeline solidified.  Women were and are further discouraged from programming careers by the reasonable fear that we'll be treated like crap.

Women are perfectly capable.  In my high school experience, young women were very much over-represented in math team and the top-track math classes, even though I went to a recently integrated school that had been all-boys only a few years previously.

I'm still seriously considering an engineering or engineering-tech career.  (Surveying?  Yeah, that sounds really appealing.)  But for me personally, overcoming a lot of misogyny, and ugly experiences with harassment, is *still* a personal challenge.  I'm not eager to generalize my experiences to women as a broad category - I'm trans and it was more often ""you can't be a girl because you like STEM"" than ""you can't like STEM because you're a girl"", but whichever way those prejudices slice I have become very much aware of them.  It's *amazing* what chauvinists will say when they think no women are listening.

Or I guess to state it more precisely: I started a career as a skilled repair worker and it was clear that I was expected to accept degrading and marginalizing women. (They treated bars and strip clubs as a kind of initiation ritual, for example.)  I was supposed to be ""one of the boys.""

I dealt with similar things while studying by deciding that I didn't care if they liked me or not.  Once I stopped trying to be nice, I found it a lot easier to deal with people who tried to dismiss me. 

I would make sure that when someone said something that questioned my competence, I took it very seriously, and didn't smile and would say yes. If he jokes around and says ""suuure ..."", I would hold eye contact and very seriously tell him that I had done it. If he then tells you to calm down, just say that you are calm (if he tries to speak over you, just keep speaking, and getting slightly louder) and that you have emailed her and you don't know why he keeps acting like you haven't. 

If you bring up an idea, don't let it be dismissed too easily.  Fight for it to be heard. So if you say, ""I think we should use X to do this"" and someone says ""No, X isn't good, we should do Y"" ask them why.  Stand up for your ideas a bit, and then if they still get dismissed and someone comes back to it later, it's easier to say - casually, and not aggressively - ""Ah yes, let's do X like I said before.""

Jeeze, that is so unprofessional and deserves naming and shaming.

Heck, at my company, even if we have strong suspicions of cheating during a coding interview, we're not allowed to confront the candidate at all and still have to give normal interview feedback (but can mention the suspicions as a side note).

And it's such a bizarre reaction, too. I've seen plenty of interview questions that I just spot the best approach instantly (and with a little luck, can avoid blunders while implementing it). When you're good with algorithm problems, that happens a *lot*.

Heck, I wish that's what most interviews were like.

As a career changer, I was also told to just go back to my old field. It would probably be easier and better for me, quite a few times.

I literally share my screen for fifteen seconds and start talking about the high level bash scripts (each calling a Python script that can also be called in other ways if the researcher so desires) which make it easy to edit the parameters, input, and output files for each experiment or running multiple experiments in one go. 

Before even getting two sentences in, my male coworker cuts me off and declares that bash scripts aren't useful and that he will not use ANY of my code. Every new sentence I say, he has a new criticism and complaint, including my choice of GitHub repository. Which was mandated by our manager.

Luckily our manager was in the meeting and after meeting with her privately, she also expressed surprised and concern over his reaction and will be speaking to him. She said she was too surprised to really respond to him then and there beyond confirming that all my work was done at her instruction and reiterating that this was the code base we were all going to use (and contribute to) moving forward.

I'm a software developer (fresh college grad) and I've been working from home for weeks now. This is new to me so I would love to hear tips and tricks and personal experiences from people in the same job and in the same situation. 

I have been going back and forth between two projects, and they used to occupy me hours at a time, and time would fly in my work-from-home sessions, but now they both hit kind of a dry spell. They both are in a point where I am not instructed to move forward yet, or I am waiting on feedback/help from other people (coworkers and supervisor) to be able to move forward. So basically I am having this block that I cannot help, and suddenly 8 hours is too long, and I feel very unproductive, unmotivated, and guilty for saying I worked 8 hours when it doesn't feel that way. I can't ask for another project or another task because once the block is gone I will be overloading myself. So it's basically a temporary waiting game for me at the moment, but it doesn't feel right. 

I get distracted with youtube, facebook, and other non-work related things because there really aren't any pressing things that need to be done. What I have been dealing with at the moment is looking through the same things over and over again. It's very unproductive, dry, and not something I can do for 8 hours and it kills my motivation. Albeit, it's gonna change and I'll be more productive eventually, my past two days have just been unproductive and I feel that it's gonna be that way for a few more days. I feel guilty for not getting any progress done even though it's not in my control. I also find it kind of wasteful to stare at a screen leading to nowhere when I can wash dishes/do the laundry/cook meals/just not work for the rest of the day. Not that I don't want to work, it really troubles me that I'm not doing as much, but it just seems counterproductive to force myself to do work that isn't there. 

This makes me wonder if anyone has experienced something similar. If so, please share your story and how you went about it. I also would like to hear very honest answers as to how people have spent their work days from home. Is it really always super productive and work-focused?

She walks through projects really thoroughly. I think walking through preplanned projects first can be helpful so you can get a sense of the layers of the application and how they all connect. It can also help you set up your environment.

You can start off with a simple CRUD web application with HTML/CSS/Javascript files. For data, you could create a database with SQL or you could download a sample test database online and connect to it as a local database.

My first project was a simple Electronic Medical Record system. It was web page with a login and had a CRUD system for managing patient data. It was all hosted locally on my computer so it wasn't hosted online. I was able to mention this project in job interviews and walk the interviewer through the process of creating it. They seemed more interested in my understand of the system than the code itself. No one ever asked to see the code. I'm not sure if that's how it is at all companies.

Also - you are NOT inadequate. The initial process of learning how to code is incredibly overwhelming. There are a lot of layers and connections to applications that don't really get taught in college, so there ends up being a lot of self taught trial and error involved. Everyone goes through it, everyone gets frustrated, and everyone feels like they aren't good enough. Its something every programmer goes through.

My coming out story is more about being trans, I accidentally came out as lesbian and it was basically just a ""oh okay"".

I came out over email to my boss. She passed it on to the big bosses/partners just so that the heads of the company were on the same page.

It was incredibly nerve-wracking. I sat down with her the next Monday, we went through names and some other stuff.

Later that week I had a new email address, the US office (not all the US staff though) team knew.

A week or two later, I can't remember I was so shot, we told a colleague who works closer with me than the others.

I had holiday a week after that, my boss let me leave early, I was shaking and so nervous I could barely speak, and she told the rest of the staff for me. That was it, everyone knew.

I came back, first day. Instantly everyone just treated me like I'd always just been myself, it was really amazing and awesome.  Only slipups were for the first few days.

I've talked a little about gender theory and queer identities with one of my (as yet unmentioned) colleagues, and she has actually been really great and I've enjoyed those chats because it's not often I get to share it.

I recently got round to doing my name change documents, and there have been a few hiccups with where the boundaries are with what can be changed when and who needs to trigger it (payslip/pension stuff) which I need to look into. 

But otherwise all has gone amazingly smooth.

The accidentally came out as lesbian happened before that coming out, kinda. I called my partner my partner, and one of my colleagues jumped to ""must be gay"" (as in dude), I corrected him and confused him because why would a ""man dating a woman"" be queer? (I've simplified that conversation a lot) Once I came out as trans everyone was like ""oh, so that's why you said partner"" so that's basically it.

I have no idea why it took me so long to come out at work (well I do, fear and employee rights), but I basically applied under my deadname so that I didn't have the bias of a woman applying for tech jobs when people saw my applications or CVs even though I'd actually been out socially for 2 years by that point.",2237,testimonial injustice,negative experience ever job come story trans accidentally come lesbian basically oh okay come email bos pass big boss partner head company page incredibly nerve wrack sit next monday go names stuff late week new email address us office us staff though team know week two late remember shot tell colleague work close others holiday week bos let leave early shaking nervous could barely speak told rest staff everyone know come back first day instantly everyone treat like always really amazing awesome slipups first day talk little gender theory queer identities one yet unmentioned colleague actually really great enjoyed chat often get share recently get round name change document hiccup boundary change need trigger payslip pension stuff need look otherwise go amazingly smooth accidentally come lesbian happen come kinda call partner partner one colleague jump must gay dude correct confuse would man date woman queer simplify conversation lot come trans everyone like oh say partner basically idea take long come work well fear employee right basically apply deadname bias woman apply tech job people saw application cvs even though actually socially 2 year point,"advice, tech, need, work, feel",0.7662950452200928,"inexperienced, bitterness, belittling, dismissing, ostracism",0.04,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.48079232949464584

Is there anyone else working in your department that you can go to with smaller questions?  I personally find that having conversations with coworkers about my projects quick starts my brain when I am stuck.  Someone closer to your skill level would also be more accommodating/understanding of questions that may seem silly to someone who's been in the industry for 30 years (btw, this doesn't mean they're actually silly -- this guy just forgets that he had to ask them himself years ago).

I've been working at a new company for a couple months now as a UI engineer, adding to the previously one-person UI team. Let's call my co-worker / mentor Adam. I have \~1.5 of professional developer experience, while Adam has close to 30 years of experience. Before I was hired, I was very upfront about my limited experience with the company's chosen framework (Angular 8 if y'all have tips!), but Adam was sure that I could pick it up with some hard work. Fast forward to a hacked together first 2 months, and I feel like I'm finally getting into the swing of things in January albeit still slowly. Here's where things start to get stressful for us both.

Adam can be quite blunt, and on a number of occasions he has stated ""if you can't get xyz right, then there's no hope for doing anything more advanced in the future"". This tied together with some DS/Algo weakness on my part has made my anxiety spike through the roof, constantly hearing that he is ""concerned I don't know the basics/am much weaker than I believe I am"", ""I don't want to write this for you"", etc. Let it be known, I've never asked for him to write any code for me, and now I'm of course afraid to ask questions about anything for fear of judgement/cause for concern. I can feel him getting annoyed with explaining some things to be and helping me debug, which I understand.

This all came to a head when I had a panic attack during one of our code reviews after being drilled and told repeatedly ""you don't seem to know what you're doing/I'm concerned you don't know anything"". I hung up our call and just broke down in the bathroom wondering why they hired me in the first place. After about 10 minutes, I muscled up and called him back (as he requested) and we talked about it. He basically said he liked me a lot as a person, and really wants me to succeed so we'll just start at square one (i.e. he wants me to know the difference between primitive values, objects, arrays...which I do but I digress) and fill in the gaps.

Now, around 2/3 weeks after this incident, I'm ""thrown into the deep end"" creating a new feature from scratch with vague instructions from the requirements and an API with lacking (meaning you hunt it down) documentation. I failed miserably / got incredibly stuck on trying to implement something in RxJS for the first time (pagination if y'all are curious), and instead of setting aside time to talk about it I am told by Adam ""I don't want to do that because I might as well be writing it myself"". So I'm stuck now with newly implemented code with no explanation and even beyond that additional code I didn't even ask for (I guess to help hurry me along). His explanation for not walking through it with me is that ""I don't seem to understand it that way anyway, so it doesn't make much difference."" He is bent on giving me easier stuff to work on while simultaneously telling me that I have to do the difficult stuff at some point to be able to actually contribute.

\--

Y'all I'm at my wits end it feels like. I trying to stay positive and tell myself they hired me for a reason, understand my mentor has never mentored before/has self awareness of his personality, and learn as much as I can. But I genuinely feel so defeated every time I commit something, preemptively believing it's going to be dead wrong and not good enough that it's impacting my work and mental health. Has anybody been in a situation where 99% of the company, work is amazing but there is 1% that just makes it beyond difficult? Also please check me if I'm just being sensitive and need to buckle up. I'm not typically emotional and try to stay positive, but this situation is wearing on me unlike any other I've come across.

**ETA: Thank you for everybody that has responded with your advice and personal experiences! I wrote this when I was still a bit in my feelings and now that I'm reflecting on it I do want to address that Adam is not a terrible person outside of code-related issues. We actually do enjoy each other's conversation when it's normal, non-work related stuff (tv, city things happening, etc.); I just think that he's really not great at being a boss/leader to someone so much his junior. It's learning curve for him as well so I don't want to paint him in a false light. I think the next steps are pretty obvious in that we need to have a discussion ASAP.

""Hi, good morning EM. I know you're not doing it on purpose, but every time introduce me in meetings and address me in groups, you've actually been calling me by the wrong name. My name is Cam-Er-On. 

It is very important to me that people call me Cam-Er-On, the name that my parents gave me. I just wanted to make you aware of how important this is to me both personally and professionally that people know me as Cam-Er-On, and as a person of authority in our workplace, I'm afraid many people have taken after your example and continued calling me by the incorrect name. 

As were about to go into a meeting with new team members who don't know me yet, I hope you will understand that I need to start correcting 'anyone' who calls me by the wrong name in the moment and politely remind them that my name is in fact Cam-Er-On. If you prefer, I am more than happy to introduce myself at the beginning of the meeting to prevent any initial confusion. Again, I know you're not calling me by a different name on purpose, but I would appreciate if you could help make sure I'm correctly known as Cam-Er-On going forward.""



Of course you should adjust to sound like you, but here's a few things I was deliberate about when typing this sample text for you. 
1) Use ""Cam-Er-On"" as often as possible without making it weird. Enunciate it clearly each time. Slow down slightly every time you pronounce your own name, but without being my condescending.
2) Never verbalize ""Carmen"". That would likely just confuse him if he ever heard you use both names in the conversation. Since he's already predisposed to calling you Carmen, that's likely the only name he'll hear.  Only refer to it passively as ""the wrong name"" or ""the incorrect name"".

---

I'm currently working with an engineering manager on one specific project. He's not my actual manager/boss, though.

The engineering manager literally always calls me by the wrong name. If my name is Cameron, he calls me Carmen. I've corrected him tens of times, to no avail. He also introduces me as Carmen to others.

Yes, we have met in-person several times. Didn't help. And yes, Cameron is my legal name. It's the name on my company stuff and email address. It's the only name I've ever had.

(Fwiw, my actual name isn't Cameron, but like Cameron, it's more often used for boys. It is recognized as a unisex name in the US, though; it's not like James or something.)

Tomorrow, I have a 3-hr virtual meeting with the engineering manager **and another team**. At our company, introductions are a normal part of inter-team meetings. I anticipate the engineering manager will introduce me as ""Carmen is a data engineer with the-xyz-team. Carmen made this tool we are going to demonstrate for you today. Carmen blah blah..."" If I correct it after he finishes the introduction, it only has a partial effect - the initial introduction sticks for some people, and they continue to call me Carmen.

This has happened before. Sometimes people who decide pay raises don't know that Cameron should get credit for Carmen work.

Tomorrow, when the engineering manager misintroduces me to the team, I must correct it immediately. I've given up on the engineering manager himself, but he cannot be allowed to ""infect"" others with the wrong name.

I have some options/questions...

1. Right as the engineering manager starts introducing me as ""Carmen-"" I would cut him off immediately and firmly with ""It's Cameron."" 😅 Is this unprofessional?

1. The engineering manager will likely continue to call me Carmen throughout the meeting. Should I correct him every time? Again, the point is to reinforce for *everyone else* in the meeting that my name is Cameron.

1. Should I say ""This is Cameron"" every time before I speak to reinforce my name? For instance, if the engineering manager says ""Carmen, what is thing X?"", I'd be like ""This is Cameron. Thing X is...""

1. We (the engineering manager, one of his direct reports, and I) have a half-hour prep meeting before the group meeting. During this prep meeting, I could tell the engineering manager, ""Let me introduce myself to the group"", meaning that he shouldn't introduce me and I would introduce myself. In previous inter-team meetings, this engineering manager has been strangely reluctant to let me introduce myself, but I can always just cut him off and start talking. 😎",2736,testimonial injustice,update http www reddit com r girlsgonewired comment w4wj2q introduce wrong name ih903da currently work engineering manager one specific project actual manager boss though engineering manager literally always call wrong name name cameron call carmen correct ten time avail also introduces carmen others yes meet person several time help yes cameron legal name name company stuff email address name ever fwiw actual name cameron like cameron often use boy recognize unisex name us though like james something tomorrow 3 hr virtual meeting engineering manager another team company introduction normal part inter team meeting anticipate engineering manager introduce carmen data engineer xyz team carmen make tool go demonstrate today carmen blah blah correct finish introduction partial effect initial introduction stick people continue call carmen happen sometimes people decide pay raise know cameron get credit carmen work tomorrow engineering manager misintroduces team must correct immediately give engineering manager allow infect others wrong name option question 1 right engineering manager start introduce carmen would cut immediately firmly cameron unprofessional 1 engineering manager likely continue call carmen throughout meet correct every time point reinforce everyone else meeting name cameron 1 say cameron every time speak reinforce name instance engineering manager say carmen thing x like cameron thing x 1 engineering manager one direct report half hour prep meeting group meeting prep meeting could tell engineering manager let introduce group meaning introduce would introduce previous inter team meeting engineering manager strangely reluctant let introduce always cut start talk,"work, job, leave, code, rude",0.6539861272908761,"inexperienced, bitterness, belittling, dismissing, ostracism",0.04,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.4842372672634146

I honestly feel I have to check myself because I feel a bit resentful towards these guys sometimes. Therefore the request for some perspective cause I don't want to be unfair.

These guys have what I consider some poor work ethics: they can be very dry, borderline rude when responding to questions, are usually late to meetings or don't accept them and don't show up, they take forever to complete their tasks and won't proactively do their work, I have to always be reminding them of their own tasks even though I'm not an engineer.

Sometimes they delay deadlines or reduce the time other non-engineer team members will have to do their work if their work comes after the engineering side. They don't involve me in meetings about the project even tho I'm their boss and apologise then do it again. They gossip and make comments about people not being smart or that managers (all women) do nothing all day. For them to do something you need to praise them and talk about how intelligent they are.

They sometimes comment on videogames they play during work hours and if there's nothing urgent they simply chill and do nothing unless you explicitely ask them. 

The country where I live is pretty good with work laws, so given that they grew up here they might be more chill about work, which is a cultural thing. But I think sometimes they take it too far! 

I'm not so good with engineering yet so I feel sometimes I have to interrogate them to decipher their work, they don't meet me half way in trying to communicate in a non-technical or even just less-technical way. And they somehow expect that I will understand their riddles of code they've been working on for weeks in the 20 min meeting we have to discuss an issue.

I feel a general lack of empathy for the work of others and over emphasis on themselves. I've had other members of my team have to do overtime because some of them took forever to complete their work before a deadline, but during all of that time said they were fine, things were fine and didn't need any help. So I don't get what was the delay about. 

I want to be fair but I have this nagging feeling that they  are spoilt brats and think they are better than others. I feel bad about this tho, because it could also be about my perspective and lack of experience...?

To give an idea of what it’s like in my team: one of my teammates literally said: “hey bitch, do this for me.” because I was oncall. I’m a dude by the way. Then another person on the team joined in on it and started making fun of my performance because I suddenly got slow(essentially being called an airhead) after being insulted. Imagine having to perform in a live setting after being called a bitch lol. What an asshole. 

It’s even worse for another person on my team since he’s struggling. Thankfully I outperform. It’s ridiculous. 

When it comes to this type of machismo stuff, you have to nip it in the bud. So I set up a meeting with the guy who called me that and let him know what I thought. He was very apologetic, and genuinely so. As a male though, you can’t be called a bitch in front of other coworkers. It creates an uneven power dynamic. So even though that coworker knows what’s what, there’s still everyone else I have to worry about. Especially that other dude who joined in, who is a senior while I’m a new grad.

I don't even know why honestly. I'm in limbo.

Background: Several months ago I asked for a promotion and a raise. I am a manager in tech. My responsibilities have drastically increased. I'm being paid significantly under market value. I was told sorry, there's no room in the budget for raises. So I said ok, I hired a career coach who did my resume and LinkedIn and I started applying and networking. Within about 6 weeks I had two interviews with two different companies and I've advanced to the final round of interviews with both.

Job Number 1: Scrum Master role (with additional responsibilities and direct reports). Established and growing software company. Highly rated company culture on Glassdoor and Indeed. Fully remote. 55% pay increase (unsure about PTO). Seems like excellent work-life balance. Final round interview next week.

Job Number 2: Director level position. Start up fiber internet company (I’d be responsible for all the software platforms which would include choosing them). There would be no direct reports for at least 12 months. I'd be wearing multiple hats. It's not my primary skillset but I think they like my personality as well as my accomplishments. Fully remote with some in office presence. 100% increase in pay. Hiring VP did tell me he works nights and weekends so I am concerned about work life balance (my kids are 5 years old and 16 months old).

I'm in final interview rounds with both. Obviously neither job has been offered to me. And it may very well come out there neither job gets offered to me. But I am really torn between the two.

Lastly, I love my boss. She has been a huge mentor for me. She supported me so much through the birth of my second and giving me a lot of leeway when I returned from maternity leave. She gives me a lot of really great feedback and support. She does not control my salary. It's her boss who does and he likes me - but he thinks I'm replaceable (and honestly the irony is they would just have to replace me with someone who will get paid what I should be making). I want to tell my boss so bad. We are really close and I just feel so guilty not telling her and I feel so guilty leaving her with the burden of filing my open role because her boss thinks I can just be replaced. And I'm not saying I can't be, but they could have avoided this by just paying me what I'm worth.

Edit to add: I also love my employees. They are awesome people. I would be really sad to leave them.

TLDR: In final interviews with two companies. Torn between the roles.

This comes up because I haven’t been a member very long as I tend to visit a subreddit a lot  before I join to make sure it’s a subreddit that I feel really comfortable with and I finally got comfortable enough to join right before the black out.
However in a post regarding mentorship’s a redditor was offering mentorship’s for women but never disclosed they were male until joining their discord to which they stated they were discussing resumes and mentorships with women which felt a bit targeted and predatory to me.

* That kind of learning can be really frustrating. From experience, if you wallow too hard in the bitterness, it can be debilitating. Work (personally, through therapy, reading, whatever works for you) to find a balanced way to view and navigate the BS.

* Make sure you network with both people in similar situations (ex. double and single minorities) and people in traditional positions of power. Both are important for career growth. (Okay someone mentioned this but I wanted to emphasize)

* Don't get stuck doing all the soft work or DEI work. It's a trap you should learn about. Focus on the work that is core to your job.

Different culture, background, everything.  The company didn’t understand me and thought everything about my home/family habits were crazy and “fucked up”.  3 Asian hires later, they were like “oh it’s not just you, it’s all of you.”  I think that company is doing better on sensitivity now but it was horrifically brutal for me for the first year learning to hide my personal details because they all thought it was some massive joke.  I made up for all of it by excelling at my job and knocking projects out of the park, but during my exit interview I definitely said “toxic culture” as a reason. 

In later companies I honestly learned to excel and be both modest and confident.  I learned that you have to play the game in most larger companies to be noticed and move up.  This doesn’t mean throwing others under the bus, but be a role model on doing good work, meeting deadlines, and maintaining positive work culture and work life balance.

I believe I started strong everywhere - work hard and earn a good reputation for being reliable to your manager and your teammates.  I am always still a little paranoid my team doesn’t respect me, but all their actions say otherwise.  Your manager and interview team will make a huge difference here too.  We hire for good fits both on personality and technical.  We support team players and helping each other.  No blame games, no pushing others down to stand taller. I make it a point to be the first to take the blame for a team-wide issue to reduce the chances of others feeling called out.

It takes an incredible amount of discipline and focus to break into the industry. Once you're in, it gets easier. My suggestion is to angle hard for QA, get some Github projects up where the focus is testing (write some UI tests with Selenium or Cypress, write some API tests, anything really). Just two or three different sets of test code will be enough, especially if you spend time on the Readmes.

Once you're in QA, it might suck for the first year or two. You will be learning A LOT and you just need to keep learning.

This won't last. Tech has had downturns before. Tech has even had labor changes that were supposed to make US developers obsolete. Outsourcing was supposed to replace us all back in the 2000s, but the work was so shoddy it usually led to more expensive fixes. AI will likely have a similar fate.

- trying to ""bait"" you with the possibility of being hired full time

I choose to not commit to full stack because I don't feel good enough. My confidence is always shot and imposter syndrome sets in hard, but today it took a really bad blow.

I created a pet project, it took far too long.. but it was MY pet project that I was passionate about, and a way for me to further learn, as well as have a tangible project of sorts where I learn some more things and build something with functionality at the forefront - as my company likes to outsource us for free (thanks Sales) and likes to start projects without contracts, ultimately both failed - but that was poor business decisions. So on my birthday I put it live..

The response I've gotten, as I've been too embarrassed to show anyone, so i showed one person and their reaction was 'do you need help with the html?', and now just had another message from someone asking me 'how is your graphic design job going?' And nothing against graphic designers (that's a generic developer rant another day) but for the most part it is a skill I do not have (if you haven't noticed from my project). However I know what went through that person's head, over 60% of graphic designers are women (thanks google), and must have known I worked with websites to some degree - so it was a generalisation because why would a girl be anything that's not a generic job title. And the guy 'offering' me html help I can't even begin to talk about without getting so angry. 

I feel like quitting, I feel like I'm in the wrong field. I love anything tech, in school they called me laptop girl - and I kind of liked it.. And I fixed people's stuff for fun..

1. Ask him if there is a more organized way that he can keep track of all these little requests that he keeps interrupting you with. Something formal (software like Jira or whatevs) so that there's a record, and a way for you to mark it as done. Ask him to prioritize everything. If marks everything as #1 priority, even the dumb little useless stuff, insist he actually put them in order.  Make sure his priority list also includes all the stuff that \*actually\* has to get done. That way, if he is insisting that you work on stupid little stuff instead of the big important stuff, and the big important stuff doesn't get done on time because of the stupid little stuff, you now have a record that \*he\* made the decision to prioritize the stupid little stuff. Also, forcing a micromanager to document their micromanagement almost always gets them to stop doing it; but in the off-chance that they actually document it, it gives you the ability to show that you are  100% completing everything they ask for.
2. If he refuses to do #1, let him know that, unless you get a concrete list and ranking of priorities that includes all these little requests, that you will have to focus on the known priorities and ignore anything else to make sure you are able to keep up with deadlines, at least until he complies with #1.

Our previous interactions had been casual and friendly, limited to short and to-the-point Slack messages. However, I've noticed a recent uptick in messages from him that carry a condescending tone. While he mentioned to the team that he has OCD and is particular about things, I also have some OCD and can understand the nuances.

He randomly messages me about things I've never been prompted on before in my ten years of professional experience, and messages me out of the blue about how long something is taking, even though I have a consistent track record of delivering features on time. He also keeps track of how many times he has to prompt me about something, such as a nitpick on a design choice made by a previous colleague, which I didn't see as necessary to change. Despite responding to his query in the pull request, he messaged me about it at three separate intervals.

While I understand his good intentions to improve the development process, he hyper-focuses on subjective matters that don't affect delivery. His daily prompts about nonsensical or unnecessary things are frustrating, and I'm unsure why our interactions have shifted from collegial to bordering on belittling. He appears to micromanage how I work, even though I haven't indicated that I need help on the things he prompts me about.

I have a coworker I’ve already reported to HR for harassment. We are unfortunately on the same team. He is very much a lone wolf, doesn’t cooperate with me, and refuses to talk to me for long periods of time. He has mentioned in the past he has feelings for me, but I can’t help him with that. He knows it’s not mutual and I’m not sure if all his antagonistic behavior stems from him feeling rejected by me. Regardless, that’s no excuse not to act professional, and I’ve tried so hard to get him to work respectfully with me. I work on an all male team, in a mostly-male department.

One thing he does constantly is swoop in to steal my thunder. We’re remote and based mostly off Slack. A problem will arise and I’ll clearly be communicating that I’m on it or looking into it. Often, the person is addressing me directly, but in a public channel. And then, out of seemingly nowhere, he will reply that he fixed it. I didn’t ask him for help. I didn’t need help. And he didn’t communicate with me that he was working on it.

I’ve tried to make my manager understand that this undermines me. It takes away an opportunity for me to grow, learn from the request/ask, or communicate with different people across the company. It makes us (as a team) look chaotic and unorganized.

Most of all, it makes me feel inferior and look like I’m incapable of handling issues that come up by myself.

My manager has only said that he doesn’t care who does the job or request, as long as it gets done or resolved.

I think part of this is showing you can handle tactful confrontation and handle it on your own. 

I’d also recommend doing it via email so you can bcc leadership if he gets mouthy. 

I had an IT person handle a situation poorly. He spoke to me in a manner I wouldn’t want to see him speak to anyone in our team, let alone company. I tactfully told him as such in my response and didn’t feed into it. He responded that he didn’t see that he did anything wrong. So I BCCd my response to my upper leader and his leader that was equivalent to me so he could handle his team. 

OPs situation is tricky because she doesn’t have a good leader over her.

The next step I would recommend is suggesting a kanban type board as follow up in an email to her manager. OP would then be offering a solution to a general problem without calling anyone out. 

*”I’ve noticed sometimes we have multiple teammates working on the same thing, and it feels frustrating because it creates duplicative work and sometimes the person that starts does not get to learn how to work through that problem. I recommend trialing a Kanban board to see if it keeps us organized and help up with productivity and collaboration. With your approval, I’m happy to explore and implement one to demo for a short period.”*

These are free, and I think it shows problem solving and initiative.

If both parties rebuff, you have a paper trail of:
1) trying to confront the issue tactfully and privately 
2) offer a solution to a problem without putting someone down.

At that point, OP can use the coworker as an example if they feel it’s not a problem.

Documentation is key, but you have to do it the right way where it doesn’t look like you are purposely attacking back or trying to bring someone down.

(I was going to put this at the end but thought better of it) The biggest advice I would give: If you have PTO, take a week or long weekend. No calls, no emails, no work. Go to a different place or go to your favorite nature area. You will need 1 day of cool off. So a day of nothing (Watch tv, go out to eat, whatever.) Then the next day, the first half will be a bit work lingering. That night is when you are you. Not work you. Then think about the following:

Find the calling that makes the most sense to you. Since you like coding, ask yourself these questions: Is my employer helpful to my career? (Burnout, wanting to change careers) Is my employer active in the pursuit of continuing my career?(Promotions, recognition) Would I be happier with a different team? (Smaller, different diversity, larger, etc...) What is my dream job? (This changes with more experience. I am finally following into my dream job from 5 years ago, CyberSecurity, as an example.)

So for 1, read this poem ( [Our Greatest Fear - Marianne Williamson](https://explorersfoundation.org/glyphery/122.html) ) it is not meant to be religious or preachy but I feel as if it has a great outlook for one of your concerns. Or rather, I think the advice to shrink yourself back is not good advice. If you know what you are talking about, you should say so. You should present the information as a decent human but you should never shrink back from fear of rejection. It does you a disservice. (Also known as Rejection Dysphoria, I have it as well... YAY ADHD... Ugh...)

The guy you would meet with 1-1 sounded like he had a stick up his ass and would have probably done the same with another male coworker. Hell, I've shut people down that do that. I'm here for a meeting, not to stroke your ego bud.

I do not talk about sports or crypto (I have friends that do and I kindly listen but when I get the chance, I change subjects. Or quite frankly, hang up.) By trade, I do IT Security. Sports is very much a conversation but not as often, thankfully...

I hate to say this, but in Tech there is a ton of guys that find girls in tech cute and they act inappropriate. The only thing I can say is, if they cross \*your\* line, push back and tell them that is inappropriate, exactly why it is and if it happens again you will report it. And do a soft report with your manager or HR. It needs to be on file anyways. (Sadly in this industry, you have to stick up for yourself more than any male out there.)

If there is a male reading this chain at all, stand up for your workmates. Even if it means getting fired. (I have. And it was actually a client of ours that I had ""defended"", I would gladly do it again.)

It's exhausting to mask yourself, yes. You should not have to. Your therapist obviously did not give you the right advice. I would say it's poor advice, especially with your career choice. In this career, you have a bunch of socially awkward dudes or dudes who have so much confidence in themselves you could light a match with their butthole. (fragile ego) So you need to match that confidence. They need to be shrinked back. Remember, it's male dominated and toxic masculinity is very much alive! How does one combat that? By swatting it down.

If your management is not taking your concerns seriously (how you presented them here.) I would say it's time to fix up your resume and move on.

>My stakeholders literally do not listen to me sometimes and I constantly question if I'm being taken seriously or if they understand that the work being shown to them by a male coworker would not be there without my input. It just fucking sucks.

If you question it to an extent of over worry, then there is a chance they are not. If it is your code, your grit, your blood, your time, your expertise. It. needs. to. be. valued. PERIOD.

If it is not valued, you take your examples of good work, use it for your interviews. Find a team that is at a minimum 50% female 50% male. If the team you currently have is DOMINANTLY male, I hate to say, this is their normal behavior. I wish it were different. Hell, I wish we didn't work 8 to 10 hours a day... Then who cares about your work mates? A little jesting but still, we spend a lot of time at work just to be unhappy.

It also sounds like you have a bit of burnout going on. Or full burnout (I'm not in your head, I don't know.). It may be time to consider moving on. Remember, the grass is not always greener but its' better than offing yourself from the anxiety. I've known too many people that are not with us anymore because of work conditions, that I wish were. (Stress).

As a male, I have spoken up about the abuse I have gone through and get told ""That didn't happen."" (Shut up and sit down and follow the status quo.) I will say, I have found my stride in being a consultant over an FTE. I minimally talk with my clients, I get the work done, I work multiple contracts at once and make about 4 times as much as I did a year ago. I still only work 40 hours a week. I just manage my time well. There are many employment options out there for you to be unhappy. I think it's time to think about what would make you happy.

Do you seriously think that when you are 10-20 years older than you are now you are suddenly going to become stupid and incapable of a job? 

As far as “passion” goes… 

1) you’ve been bragging about doing basically no work this sprint on a thread about people who only work 2-3hrs a day. How is that evidence of passion?

2) not all CS grads have “passion”,  and young people rarely know what they want to do with their life (even the ones who think they do, given a bit more experience will often change their mind). Most people will have multiple occupations in their life and a lot of those future jobs don’t even exist yet. 

3) not all CS grads are young, plenty of those older people you look down get a cs degree. So if your opinion is driven by your ageism, form of education is irrelevant.

4) you haven’t bothered to spend any time actually understanding the diversity of reasons people choose to work as a software engineer, and these reasons are not related to what form of training someone gets. If someone is motivated by money, they might get a cs degree OR go to a bootcamp ( or do both!). Ditto if they are driven by “passion”.

The brain doesn’t significantly deteriorate until very late in life, or for certain health conditions. Programmers are more than capable of coding well into their 60s, until they are ready to retire.

However, performance in a work environment has as much to do with behavioural skills, and people reskilling into tech a decade or two later have had that much extra time to develop advanced behavioural skills over someone younger. That makes a world of difference in what it’s like to work with someone. 

For example, knowing how to take initiative to see what needs doing and get in and do it rather than kicking back and waiting for someone to tell you what to do (such as waiting around for  PM to assign you work, rather than finding it yourself).

As far as education quality goes… the time it takes to do a 4 yr degree, someone could do a bootcamp plus self learning (all the curriculum of a degree is available free online btw, can learn all the same stuff if you want) , get a job and have a few years professional experience under their belt. You learn way more on the job than in a university. University is slow, academic, and spoon fed compared to working in the industry - and most bootcamp grads know this because they already have a degree  and work experience in another field so they have a good comparison to draw on when making a decision about what is the most efficient way for them to learn these skills. 

University is a very 20th century solution that has failed to keep pace with changes in society that mean degrees are often out to date by the time students graduate and we are forever learning throughout our careers both on the job and self learning. Uni still has a purpose but mostly for either people who want a career in academia/research or people straight out of school who still have some growing up to do before they’ll be ready to enter the professional world.

Bootcamp grads are eager to get started on their career and know they’ll learn more on the job doing the actual work rather than waste time to sitting exams, writing essays, and working on school projects.

Every argument you make can also be said in reverse. There are both horror and success stories for both CS grads and bootcamp grads. 

For example, CS degrees also have a high fail rate, a lot of people who start CS degrees switch to other studies or take a non developer role after graduation. Does that make CS degrees a scam? Does that make CS grads stupid and incompetent? 

Whatever path people take, some will succeed, will fail.

How you account the value of a CS degree is very subjective. 

What does a person achieve in 4.25 years if they succeed in their career goal to be a developer?

- CS student spends 4 yrs at uni, followed by job 3 months search, to get an entry level job either grad program, junior or associate level.

- bootcamp grad spends 3-12 months at a bootcamp and self study, followed by 6 months job search, to get an entry level job either grad program, junior or associate level, gets several years of experience and a promotion to mid level.

And what does it look like if someone fails, whether because they aren’t good enough or decide they don’t like it?

- CS student may fail or drop out or switch at any point in time in the 4 year degree OR may be a good “student” and do well at uni from a grades perspective (or may cheat to get foot grades) and only realise 4.25yrs later when they have a job that they actually hate it or may struggle to get a job as a developer and take something easier.

- bootcamp student will find out pretty quick if this path isn’t for them, either in the bootcamp, the job hunt, or their first job - can end up in any of the same places as the CS student but learns this lesson faster.

Neither bootcamp nor CS degree are capable of teaching “everything”. 

Bootcamp is training specifically developing the skills needed for an entry level job in the industry; and then you learn more on the job and through ongoing professional development.

CS degrees are more theoretical and generalised. They teach a little bit of a lot of different topics, of which only a small proportion will end up being relevant to your career. They don’t teach all the skills needed for specific roles (that bootcamps focus on). Graduates are still going to have to learn a lot on the job and throughout their career.

As far as behavioural skills go, do a little research. It doesn’t matter if you hire smart talented knowledgeable people if they are incapable of working well together. We work as teams in organisations and everything we do requires good communication, organisation, team work… (behavioural skills). There is a world of difference between working with people with a good attitude and toxic personalities. Coding is only a fraction of the job, and will be hampered if there is bad communication, disorganisation and behaviour.

As far as “meeting smart people”… lol.

Woah. This is totally weird and wild to me because I remember seeing the kinds of ""In the future, you might use this..."" type articles about satellite or other electronic navigation in the usual places like Popular Science or Popular Mechanics.

One notable early mention I remember is from the book The Kids Whole Future Earth Catalog which I believe was published in about 1979-81, which is just a few years after the start of the GPS project in 1973, and just about the same time frame that the first prototype satellite was launched in 1978, and long before the constellation was fully completed and operational in 1993.

And the segment in that book is definitely talking about civilian GPS and full on sat-nav, not just terrestrial navigation aids like LORAN. The article is accompanied by illustrations of a GPS receiver the size of and worn like digital watch.

I'm not really doubting that she could have been so deep into military research that the civilian applications never really crossed her mind especially since computers and GPS receivers of the time were so huge and expensive, but I'm just kind of boggling over here that she never once thought ""Hey, you know, you could put one of these receivers in a car with some digital maps or something and never get lost again!""

You can get millimeter precision but usually only with many repeated measurements over time on a base station, and it's used for things like measuring Earth movements from tectonic plates or land slipping in landslides or due to construction.

Phone GPS systems definitely does use more than just GPS signals for increased accuracy and some of those sources are cell phone towers.

Some stand-alone GPS receivers use other sources like terrestrial beacons like WAAS (aviation beacons) or competing satellite networks like Galileo or Russia's GLONASS to cross reference measurements and increase accuracy.

Today most consumer receivers are about a 5 meter accuracy, which can be brought down to about 2 meters with augmentation.

L5 commercial GPS receivers can get down to centimeters on GPS alone, but to get to millimeters with just GPS you basically need a static base station set up taking many measurements and averaging them out over time.

Something else to note about the satellite GPS constellation and constellations of satellites in general is not only is relativity an issue to accuracy but you have to account for the ""lumpiness"" of the Earth's gravity field because gravity warps space *and* time.

IE, the relativistic clock speed differences of a GPS satellite in orbit compared to a base station can vary depending on which orbit it's in around the planet and how much of the Earth's lumpy mass is effecting the satellite.

They have to regularly correct for these errors by calibrating the pseudorandom timecode that GPS uses by referencing it to a number of atomic reference clocks on the ground.

I don't know what the rate of decay is for this accuracy without corrections, but if the GPS constellation wasn't regularly updated and corrected it would start to drift a lot relatively quickly.

This is a wild guess, but I would guess something on the order of weeks or months before would degrade to the point you would only be able to achieve precision of kilometers instead of meters because the GPS system is just that sensitive and we're talking about something like microseconds of clock drift per day.

*checks wikipedia* Wait, no, I'm wildly wrong about that. It's more like **kilometers per day* of increased inaccuracy without corrections.

So without regular updates and corrections GPS would be mostly useless in about 24 hours.

Remote will be hard if you're junior though and I wouldn't recommend it for a first job, unless you really vet the team you'd be working with and understand how you'll get unstuck when you get stuck. 

I was offensive for years so the advice I can give would be to do some CTFs, practice and learn the new tools, try your hand at as many bug bounties and hackathons as you can and ask questions! Read as much as you can and you'll never learn it all, but that's okay. you'll begin to see patterns.  Offensive peeps often write up the things they do online and give some step by step walkthroughs. 

Another avenue to think about is all 4 big consulting firms have red teaming and offensive sec in NYC and they're down to invest in training people. I'd try to make contact with some of them. Honestly if you want to go offensive I'd be looking at 1. bigger companies which have dedicated shops and 2. more boutique cyber firms that offer red teaming/vuln assessments, etc. as a service 3. government opportunities where you can learn. NYC (the city) has amazing opportunities in their cyber world as well as NYPD and other agencies that have offices there. 

the goal as a junior white hat is to get as much experience as you can. I know it can be disheartening because offensive is competitive, NYC is busy, and companies aren't all hiring right now but I'm sure you'll be able to do it. Don't take the rejections and think that it's because you're a girl. If it is, you don't want to be on their team anyway. It sucks sometimes that you feel like you need to do more to be better but I like to look at it as a forcing function.

I did a little bit of freelance work that I picked up on the /r/ForHire type subs, but mostly I just spent my time applying for jobs and trying to learn new stuff. i was really lucky in that my partner has a decent job, and he was able to support us during that time, so i could concentrate on studying and job-hunting. I know that's not a privilege that everyone has though.

It was a big struggle for me taking that long to find my first programming job, and it definitely got me down a lot. I think part of the reason it took me so long was because I was feeling so disheartened, I kinda procrastinated about job applications because I felt like I couldn't face any more rejection emails or ghostings. If I'd managed to push myself through that I maybe would have succeeded in finding something a bit earlier, but we'll never know!

Once you have the experience from the first job, it's so much easier to find another position though, despite the lack of a degree. It took me 3 weeks this time round, I was actually getting too many emails from hiring managers which was definitely a nice problem to have after last time!

Honestly, at the time, it all sucked massively and I felt like I'd made a mistake. Looking back on it, it was the best thing I've ever done, and I love programming as a career.

I have been working with a coworker for 10 years. I started at this company when I was [redacted]. He is quite older than me and we work in the same department (IT). The department is mostly men, and the other females work remotely. I genuinely care for this person as they have good intentions. On good days, we have really interesting conversations. I consider them a close work friend. 

Since I've worked with him I've dealt with tons of outrageous remarks. [redacted]

I've worked this year to be firmer in setting boundaries. But these last few weeks he has really amped up his antics.

During the last month he has:

-[redacted]

-called me darling multiple times.

-told me I need to smile more.

-told me we are going to have to do professional mouth to mouth. 

-doted on me in general ""oh you're so prettyyy""

Yesterday I closed the door in face. And today It got to the point where I told him today ""Jesus fucking christ. No. Stop"". But it has continued. 

Over the years Ive let it slide. I want to make sure everyone feels comfortable and isn't walking on eggshells. I appreciate dark humor.
And I feel extremely guilty to say this - Sometimes I'm okay with a little bit of mild flirting, or silly jokes. I'm human and I'm not perfect.

It is hard for me to justify setting a boundary when I'm okay with some things, but not other things. 

Lately though I've been feeling extremely angry and borderline violent towards this coworker's behavior. It's a distraction. It's disrespectful. It makes me want to throw my computer at his face. Nobody else acts the way he does. 

I feel like by going to HR it would be a betrayal. We've known each other for 10 years and I've only recently started setting boundaries. But he doesn't seem to be understanding.

How can I possibly handle this without getting HR involved or hurting feelings?

Also I'm going to be honest here, his behavior isn't a secret and it would be so much easier if another coworker stepped in and spoke up for me. [redacted] He never stands up for me. He just laughs. Despite him being super nice it makes me want to fucking punch him.

You were only 18 when you started working there. You learned about what was appropriate for a workplace from this environment. It's no wonder it took you time to start pushing back on inappropriate behavior that was normalized in the only workplace you knew. 

He, on the other hand, had plenty of experience by that point and should have known better from day 1. 

> How can I possibly handle this without getting HR involved or hurting feelings?

What about your feelings?? You've put other people's feelings above your own for the last ten years. I'm not saying you shouldn't try to navigate this diplomatically if you want to keep working here and/or maintain relationships with these folks, but keeping the peace is not working for you. 

You're tolerating a LOT of disrespect to keep the people who are disrespecting you comfortable. 

> The other guy is a good ""Christian"" man but doesn't fucking say shit. He never stands up for me. He just laughs. Despite him being super nice it makes me want to fucking punch him.

I honestly think this makes him just as bad. He's tolerating it, and he's *laughing.* That's not nice behavior. 

> I genuinely care for this person as they have good intentions.

Ok, so. What should you do? If I were in your shoes, I would find a new job. 

But if you want to or need to stay, you're set against going to HR at this point, and you really think this person has good intentions...I would write down what's bothering you very clearly and appeal to him to change his behavior. I don't think you need to explicitly threaten to contact HR, but I do think you should put your issues in writing. Printing it out feels a little weird buuut you could chalk it up to wanting to make sure he understands how seriously it's bothering you. Tell him you respect that he has good intentions and that's why you're appealing to him directly to please stop these behaviors that make you feel so uncomfortable and disrespected at work. 

I'd say to email it to him if it weren't for your help desk policy - however, after you've had your initial conversation with him, I would suggest following up on issues via email with careful phrasing, ex 'the way you spoke to me just now made me uncomfortable and that's the type of behavior I asked you to change in our previous conversation.' Vague and no words to trigger the policies, but clear documentation of a pattern after each instance of disrespect. 

Best case, he changes his behavior.

By the time I got to college, I had been pressured into liking stem so much that I told myself it me who wanted to do it, and I tried three times to major in computer science before dropping it entirely.

I've been really into STEM my whole life, but I've never had the opportunity to study it in a formal setting with it counting towards a degree due to hate. 

For my entire life, from the early 80's through the present, there has been a massive amount of bigotry directed towards women and minorities who are into STEM, and direct efforts to keep us out of the field/s, especially to keep us from making meaningful contributions.

My intellect is literally met with violence, so I have to keep it to myself.

And on the lighter side of things, if I go to a conference or meeting for developers, are my thoughts and ideas welcome? Am I welcome to speak, to exchange thoughts with people? Absolutely not. They look at me like I'm really stupid and say, ""I . . . work . . . with . . . computers,"" as if I would struggle to understand even that sentence. And if I say anything of substance, they just respond, ""You're amazing!"" and walk away like they're turning down a sexual advance. It's disgusting. 100% exclusion and dehumanization.

The same thing or worse in every area of STEM. All the time.

Does anyone take responsibility for this? Do they want to hear from those of us who read text books in our spare time because formal study was not available to us and who have ground-breaking ideas on important subjects?

No. Absolutely not. They want to treat us like children and give us infantilizing, ""You can do STEM!"" bullshit. Bullshit that's based on the assumption that we're scared and stupid and need something ""less intimidating."" 

It's all based on bullshit assumptions about women and minorities. They're insulting us and enforcing stereotypes instead of addressing the actual issues.

I totally sympathize and am in a similar situation. I had 3 good years under my supervisor and after a falling out she has bullied me for the last 2 years. I have been living with constant anxiety of not getting my PhD. For 2 years now she has first stalled my thesis review process and currently my defense. I need to explain why I took a ridiculously long time or even not getting a PhD at all if this don't go well.

Here is what I have considered so far:

- back-up references: Do you have an external adviser or collaborator on research project who can vouch for you? Put these people on job applications. 

- side projects: Do you have side projects you did during your PhD? E.g. I joined an NGO (I am a marine ecologist and did ocean NGO work), so I will put this under my achievements. I also joined 2 research projects outside of my lab that serve as achievements and references and explain what I did for 5 years.

- consider publishing alone: once you have your PhD, you don't need to include abusers on your research. Consider publishing alone, keep your data safe on your own PC.

- report the case: depending on how my mediation goes, which just started last week, I will either report my supervisor after or before my graduation. Can you report it too? This will give you proof that your harassment case was real and not your fault.

- be honest: depending at what study you look at, harassment in academia is more common than anywhere else and especially in STEM and numbers are between 25-50% or even more. Read these studies. Memorize the facts and be honest on your CV and in the interviews about the fact that you have been harassed. Keep it brief and factual. Since Harvey Weinstein, this has come to the light and people can not brush you off anymore. Plus you wouldn't want to work for someone who does, so this will work as a filter to guarantee you a safe future workplace. Plus, you might even meet interviewers who experienced the same as you! I understand that harassment destroys your selfworth. I have seen myself as the party at fault for this for 2 years and blamed it on me. So I wanted to hide it and also considered lying. Don't let it happen. Then you become part of their dirty plot.

I am still at loss myself on how to make the best of this, but I learnt that becoming visible, speaking up and being proactive is the only thing that will break the cycle.

I am very experienced in the field. I left academia because I was too traumatized to continue. I’d love to get back into my field (never in academia though).

**It took me three goes to get my PhD, how do I explain that on my resume?**

I left PhD #1 in field A due to violence, jumped into PhD #2.1 in field B because I was afraid to work in field A again, then went back to field A starting PhD #2.2. 

Has anyone had experience with this? I don’t want to look unreliable because if anything I’m super committed to achieving my goals given what I had to face. I’m thinking I lie about PhD #1, but how can I cover up a 18 month gap after undergrad? What is a good lie I can tell - gap year, illness, took a job to pay debts or something? I can’t really say I “worked” for the PhD #1 guys because they might just call up the PhD #1 guys and ask them about me.

=========================================
Backstory:

* PhD #1: left after being physically attacked by colleague. After reporting I was severely bullied and called lazy because I wouldn’t work alone at night as my attacker could have easy access to me. Nothing happened to the guy, everyone felt so sorry for him because some crazy lady couldn’t get over the fact he’d just made a small mistake by attacking me that one time.I experienced other forms of sexual harassment almost daily. FYI my attacker was known for his violence by the “low status people”, but I was the only one to report him.

* PhD #2.1: got funding to work in slightly different field - took it to escape and not give up my dream of a PhD. Nice folks, but the work was a cinch and I missed my old field. Met head of school from undergrad major who said I could come back anytime and he’d make it happen. I couldn’t resist.

* PhD#2.2: what I should’ve done in PhD #1. It was hell, but no one attacked me so I could do it. Met rape survivors, had a professor viciously call me a “fucking bitch” because I stopped talking to him after he said creepy sexual stuff to me, other guys said creepy stuff to me all the time, was told girls are shit, was bullied and watched colleagues bullied every day (our senior researcher liked to tell us how shit we were), had female colleagues confessed they cried daily in the toilets (who doesn’t?) and so, so much more.

I use to ask if anyone had the same experience as me, but all I get are comments and questions about why I am in that situation. Why I am the primary caretaker, why I am doing what I am doing for my family. It gets exhausting.

I was a full time student, caretaker, and worked 3 jobs. 1 full time, 1 weekend, and 1 night time.

&#x200B;

My advice is, even though counselors can be and was useless for my situation, talk to counselors at school and ask them about financial aid. Go dig for resources at school. Some schools will help you apply for financial aid for schools, give you directions for food banks (referrals), etc.

Take advantage of all the help/resources you can get. EBT/food stamps, rent books, borrow from library, download books, study at libraries, free snacks. I went through some courses even without books because I just couldn't afford it. I ended up just googling everything and hope for the best. When I struggle, I reach out to my instructors and hope they understand and be nice enough to answer my questions.

&#x200B;

Try to find a day job that pays more than your night job. Then slowly phase out your night job and while keep finding a day job that pays even more. Rinse and repeat. If you end up finding a night job that pays more than your day job, just keep repeating this cycle. Brutal but that is how I got through it all.

Eventually you will find a job that pays just enough (or more) that will give you flexibility to study. Then use that time to skill up.

I am a gay female engineer with ADHD in a male dominated company where the majority of the other engineers are white males aged anywhere from 55-75. I am also an engineering manager. I expect downvotes but I just have to say this.

  
I mostly am responding because the way you're phrasing your complaints about the feedback on your work process is coming across as a problem to me. Reading your original post and also many of your replies, I am getting this mindset from you: ""I have ADHD and so I work in this specific way and any feedback about it is an attack, and I shouldn't have to change or even consider it because this is JUST THE WAY I AM"".  


It sounds like you think the way you work is perfect and are absolutely unwilling to work on it, and are offended they'd even talk about it because it's your 'disability', even if it means you're causing problems on your team. Well, this just isn't realistic. I have pretty severe ADHD that comes with a heavy dose of Executive Disfunction. I can say with 100% confidence that if I told my boss that I can't wake up before 11AM, and then I can't make myself work unless I am suddenly inspired for a couple hours once in a while, and that meetings are complete gibberish that I cannot force myself to pay attention to, and that I am going to spend 8 hours developing a feature that no one asked for because it seemed interesting to me and I went down a rabbit hole, etc etc... I would no longer be employed.   


These are things I struggle with daily, and they do not fit in with a job that expects specific results. I am also an extreme introvert and hosting a dozen O3 meetings per week is a massive emotional and psychological challenge for me, but I am working my ass off to improve them. I am taking medication, setting alarms, writing myself notes, reading books about interpersonal communications, and doing everything I can to fit into the role I decided I wanted.   


If I walked into my annual review and my boss said that I have trouble completing tasks, or I am not responsive early mornings, or my employees are complaining about our meetings -- I wouldn't be annoyed and accuse him of diagnosing me. I would either figure out more ways to adapt to the job, or I would find a job that fit me better if that were impossible. Maybe self employment. I have left jobs before that didn't give the flexibility I needed, and have found that one of the things I need to succeed is flex-time, because sometimes I am literally incapable of working.  


You simply cannot show up to a job every day and treat people abrasively/poorly, then do whatever you want because that's your ""process"" and it works for you, and expect a sunshine and roses response. That's the ""Rockstar"" developer mindset, and I absolutely hate it. No one is so great that they don't have to try to work well within the team. I wouldn't accept this from my coworkers or my employees, regardless of their gender.

I was also a software engineer, and for just as long (longer, even). I never had these experiences. I'm not trying to dismiss or invalidate OP's experiences. I don't doubt OP one bit, and it totally sucks. No one should have to put up with that BS.

However, I wish people wouldn't make sweeping statements like ""his word will _always_ be believed over yours"". If you find yourself in a situation where these things are true, you should leave. Don't settle for a job where your co-workers/management don't respect you. Better jobs are out there.

Respectfully, if at every job, you think people are dismissing or belittling you because of your gender, you should take a step back and ask yourself if you're contributing in some way. Hard truth: Maybe sometimes the problem isn't your gender, but your work or your people skills. It's like the old saying ""If everyone you meet is an asshole, you might be the problem."" A repeating pattern across multiple jobs/years should make you think. IME, men in software development aren't some monolithic Bro Monster. Or maybe it's the industry segment. I'm sure misogyny is worse in some than others. Try to make a shift.

For context, I was not some meek little mouse who was left in peace because she was no threat to anyone. I didn't hesitate to respectfully challenge my co-workers or management. I wasn't that star developer everyone fawns over. Not even close. I was just a hard working, reliable, team-oriented professional with good people skills. I had leadership positions and grunt positions. I got into management when I was ready to try it. I turned my hand to whatever needed to be done for a successful project, whether that was architecture or dirty work. Sometimes, it was both. Be a team player.

I mostly worked with and for men. Sometimes there were jerks or people I didn't like or bad managers. Sometimes my opinions were respected and acted upon, sometimes they weren't. That's real life. It happens to men, too. Most of us, male or female, are just there to do the best job we can at delivering the software. Who has time to care about what's between your legs?

In fact I think it should be encouraged. I was the same way into my first job after college. I needed so much guidance for every tickets from either my colleague or my manager, and over time started to feel very inadequate about this. 

But then I reminded myself that the people I'm asking help from have been at the company longer and generally have more experience, and they're supposed to know more. They're supposed to be fully able to provide guidance. And I kept telling myself that someday I will be at their level too, but I will need a lot of help in the process. Both from them, and myself.

And that helped to unabashedly ask questions, and more importantly, ask better questions. Every time a coworker or my manager agreed to help me, I would at first tell them what I did so far to understand the question or how much code I looked at and just talk about however little I understood. That way they know at the very least I tried, and now I'm asking for help. Yes there were still times my manager looked at me like I'm kind of dumb to need help something so simple from their point-of-view, but that's just something you're going to have to tolerate in order to get better.

Another advice I can give you is everytime you ask help for a problem and get the help, note down the whole process and what you learnt in a document somewhere. That way you won't need to ask the same question again.   


I've been at my job for 3 years now, and can say that I ask for help significantly frequently as I used to, and can do most things myself. And always do my best to help out any of the newcomers that need  help. Experience makes a lot of difference really.

I explored some other career paths. Maybe I wanted to get into UI/UX. 

But then when I started applying for new jobs, the company that bought my old division wanted to hire me. 

Its been so awesome, I love my job and I am so happy. 

6 months ago I would not be able to leave my bed, crying and feeling complete apathy. I even would think “what if I wasn’t here anymore”.

I got a B.S. degree in CS in 2016 and started working as a SWE in infrastructure/distributed systems at Twitter for 6 years. Over those six years, I went to school part time and got an M.S. degree in CS and got promoted to Senior SWE. Those six years were pretty good- my team was diverse, my manager was supportive, the work was interesting, and I was proud of everything I accomplished there. I decided to leave Twitter when the Elon Musk stuff started happening which was a good call. 

I joined another Big Social Media Company in what I thought was a similar role to my job at Twitter. The role ended up entailing almost no software development and was almost completely dev ops, which I had no experience with but was happy to learn. I was disappointed when my manager assigned someone else to the exciting project he had told me about while I was in the recruiting process and I continued to get extremely tedious and difficult dev ops work. After only 1 month of onboarding, my manager started giving me lots of negative feedback, saying I needed to have a “hunger” and “passion” for tech. He kept reminding me of my Senior job title and telling me I wasn’t meeting expectations and not working hard enough. This was super upsetting to me as I’d only had a month to get up to speed but I started working more and more hours anyway. But no matter how much work I put in, I never seemed to meet his insane expectations and he constantly criticized me in our 1:1’s and in slack in front of my teammates. I was the only woman on my team (~10 ppl) and in our org (~40 ppl) which was already very uncomfortable for me, and I was clearly being targeted by my manager (my teammates would never admit he’s a misogynist but acknowledged that he sometimes “plays favorites” LOL). My manager got more and more aggressive, interrupting me constantly, brushing off my concerns, and blaming all the obstacles/blockers I encountered on me not working efficiently enough. He was always breathing down my neck, asking for status updates at all times of day/night, despite our daily standups where I had already given my updates. Despite all of this, I never stood up for myself and pushed myself to work harder, and his behavior only became worse. 

One day, after six months at this terrible job, my manager scheduled a second impromptu 1:1 with me to gather another status update in which I told him all of the things I’d done and everything I had planned to do over the next month. Everything seemed fine until he sent a follow up email summarizing the meeting we’d had and concluding the email with “As a reminder, as a SENIOR software engineer, it’s your job to come up with these tasks independently :)” and that was the final straw for me because I did come up with those tasks independently. He was clearly leaving a paper trail to fire me and trying to misrepresent our meeting to make me look incompetent, and I responded to his email to correct him and fuck up his little paper trail and he avoided me for the rest of the week. I quit the following Monday and gave 4 days notice. I had to return my signing bonus because I’d only been there 6 months, but it was worth it, I couldn’t take it anymore. Everyone said to wait for him to fire me so I could keep the signing bonus but I truly could not bear it any longer.

When I gave my manager my notice, he didn’t even ask why, and he didn’t speak to me ever again (yay!). I did an exit interview with HR who politely noted my complaints but clearly didn’t care. Everyone told me not to say anything negative in my exit interview because burning bridges is bad and what if my manager tells his peers not to hire me, but I gave my polite and honest truth anyway because I’m done with this industry. I’m not getting another job in the tech industry- I’m done with 24/7 on-call weeks, misogynist managers, and tedious bullshit work. I saved all my money while working in tech, so I’m living off my savings to finally pursue my personal passion tech projects. When I run out of money, I’ll probably start teaching CS.

A possible way is listing the things you do and consider the business impact to the client company. Not the work size or difficulty, but the value it brings when done.  When that's done, consider your capacity and create a proposed task list covering the most impactful things, preferably starting with the best impact/effort ratio. If there are less impactful things that critical to keep for whatever reasons, add those to the mix, but don't exceed your capacity (remove something else when you somethingto the list). You will end up with a list you propose to do and a list you will not have capacity to do (on hold).

Calibrate those lists with your stakeholders. First talk with your manager at the client company. Do they agree with the impacts? Do they agree with the capacity allocation across topics? Is there something in the on hold list that should be switched with an item in the todo list? Is it possible to delegate or share anything from the on hold list?

Once you have an agreement with your client manager, show the same list to the team lead and scrum master. Discuss expectations. If they disagree with the lists, get them together with your client manager and settle the open points.

Repeat the process later or agree on capacity % allocation across topics. 

Don't let them squeeze in just one more item without removing or scoping down another one. Be respectful, constructive and open to change the list through the whole exercise. 

If you have a good relationship with your reporting manager, you could also ask for their advice on the situation.

What does your contract say about early termination, and undelivered work? You must read every single sentence in that contract ASAP to find out what the situation is. 

If the language allows you to leave with notice, then do that. If the language says it's a 4 month contract and nothing else, then you'll have to ask to have it mutually terminated.

> Does anyone have advice on how to navigate the conversation?

The easiest thing to do is to contact both parties and tell them the truth: You'd like to take this new job asap but you're currently on a 4 month contract. The job might hold it for you until your contract finished (Jan?), or the contract might be willing to let you go early. 


ps, as an aside, the idea of hiring a new grad on a 4 month contract is completely insane, as 99% of that time you're going to be relatively useless and in no-way a solo operator.

The most cited person enables you to find out who is respected in the field, hence, to should request that individual to be your advisor. But I think you should also email those individuals because your rejection might just be due to the lack of bandwidth that potential advisor has, and not necessarily you or your abilities.

Once you have shortlisted potential advisors, you should start narrowing the list down to based on institution. Try to select schools where there are other professors that you may want to be your backup advisor cause who knows, a respected individual may be a terrible advisor or a dick.

He basically told me that my company cares about diversity, specifically women in tech, and that they would like for me to become more visible in the workplace because there is an obvious lack of women in leadership roles.  He suggested that I touch base with one of our recruiters to discuss how I can play more of an active role as one of our senior tech members.

I was pretty involved in extracurricular activities when I first started working out of college. I helped organize hackathons, women in tech meetups (at the direction of our recruiting team), and organized other activities for our software engineering groups.  However, I quit caring about these activities when I became a manager two years ago because I no longer had enough time with my increase in responsibilities.  

Now that I am 32, I could care less about my image  because I want to settle down and have a family;  participating for these kinds of events just means I will have to put in more overtime and volunteer for work events that last the entire weekend. I already work a minimum of 50 hours a week, and I would rather spend the time with family, brushing up on my technical skills, or enjoying other hobbies.

My company has previously stated that they will always hire diverse candidates if they are qualified; even if there is not an open position for them.

I told my manager that I would find it deeply insulting if I was promoted due to my gender, and while he wasn’t direct, he made a comment that the company is going to continue ‘promoting people quickly.’

While I have not had my direct coworkers treat me differently as a woman, I know that other women software engineers have not had as good as an experience as I have.  Regardless, I feel like this kind of affirmative bias ultimately hurts women in the field because it perpetuates imposter syndrome (which I have), as well as create doubt as to whether or not someone has actually earned their position.

I guess this is just a rant.  I am passionate about introducing young girls to the stem field, but I do not want to be the ‘token’ female engineer.

2. she didn't mention her shortcomings in the post (the things the recruiters claimed she was at fault for)

I was also let go completely out of the blue without a PIP or any indication or feedback that I wasn't doing well. It was after I gave feedback to my manager's manager that some of his actions in a meeting with me are very commonly cited as disempowering to women in the workplace, e.g. speaking over me, explaining for me, not listening to something I said until another male colleague repeats it, etc. Two weeks later, I was let go because they said I ""wasn't performing up to expectation"". They gave me zero feedback on this before, so I have a strong suspicion that it was retaliatory because my skip manager really did not take the feedback well.

At the end of the day, you were working with people who did not treat you with respect. There is underlying misogyny that you can feel, just by the way they were treating you and not taking you seriously. Do not discount that. I've been working for 10 years in tech, and it has taken me a long time to realize that I'm not stupid, but people not listening to me or respecting me makes me feel incompetent and not worth listening to. OP - you're not stupid or worthless. We have been conditioned to ""not be too sensitive"" and question if it's them or us. Yes, you can always improve your product and communication, but these men aren't treating you with basic respect, and you deserve that.

I've also been really struggling with how to approach this in the future. I'm really tired of swallowing this treatment but it feels like the sad truth of the world is that you can't really fight back as directly as we'd like. So yes, I wouldn't be so open in recruiting talks, just focus on what you've brought to the business. And if this happens in the future, try to build alliances with other powerful leaders and peers to support you so 1) you can work more closely with them and less with the assholes and 2) you protect yourself from being fired if you have other people in power on your side.

Again, I'm so sorry. This doesn't define you. You did your best, and you are worthy. You deserve people who see your value and treat you with kindness and respect.

As others have said, practice is key. The more you talk in front of others, the more you learn that it's OK. Also, everyone makes mistakes and occasionally says things wrong. Don't be too hard on yourself, it happens to everyone.

Some resources: 
* Check out Toastmasters - it's often recommended for practicing public speaking.

* More expensive, but very worth it IMHO: Dale Carnegie training. I took [Skills for Success](https://www.dalecarnegie.com/en/courses/5219) many years ago and it was amazing. My in person classes were 8 weeks, 3 hours a week, 2 presentations each week. With that huge amount of practice, I had a very noticeable drop in public speaking stress after that course.

* Lastly, don't discount a therapist. Anxiety can come from some weird places and thoughts, and having a professional to talk to can be very helpful.

And keep in mind that it can take a while to overcome anxiety. Go easy on yourself, and don't beat yourself up if your progress is slower than you'd like.

Find your unfair advantage to get a job. Find what you can do differently that will stand out. Here are some quick suggestions:

* Build connections and a project portfolio via open-source github contributions if your resume and existing project portfolio is inadequate.
* Start a side project and launch an app related to the area of technology you want to go into.  You'll learn a lot and have something you can show and link to when you apply for jobs.
* Learn specializations. Instead of pursuing a general software engineering role, can you invest in very high demand specializations like cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, or mobile? Even better if you can show your knowledge by building something. Companies will have hiring freezes in some areas but the hottest technology shortages continue to have very high need.
* Reach out to engineers for informational interviews about what they do and see if some of the informational interviews could results in them giving feedback on projects your working on, connections into companies, or ideas around who is hiring. This idea would work even better if you reach out to eng managers because they will potentially have enough power to open up an internship directly for you.
* Though a lot of companies are not focused on junior talent, there is an increased emphasis on developing early career pipelines. Most major tech companies have programs  to increase diversity and build onramps for the next generation. You can search and identify companies who have these programs.
* Create an internship! Know the role you want to have and try to be as specific as possible about the type and size of company. Reach out to people at the company to build relationships, especially outside of HR.

My personal feeling is: I can't tell anyone what their experience is. If you say you're a woman, you're a woman. And I know it's not a choice, as such. If you tell me you're on my team, when women are at a disadvantage, I say, the more, the merrier. No uterus required. 

Sometimes, my groups talk about how we can be more inclusive, so that anyone who is non-binary/genderfluid/questioning can feel welcome as well. The spirit of the group is: it's for people who face discrimination to find camaraderie. 

Anyway. For those women I've worked with and are in my women's group that I know are trans, we never talk about it directly. Their transitions were fairly public so everyone knows they were assigned male at birth. In general, it feels like I would be rude or awkward to bring up the subject. Like, ""Hey, so, you're trans! How's that going?"" 

I remember similar awkwardness talking about issues with my black coworkers (I am white). When Michael Brown was killed, I started a conversation about it and it was like floodgates opened and then we talked a *lot*. 

So maybe everyone is just waiting for someone else to say something.

Although overall, my advice to you would be to try to focus more about what you think of yourself than what anyone else thinks. I would say the same thing to a cis het white man. What other people think ultimately doesn't matter. What matters is you are content and respect yourself. 

FWIW I don't know what it means to ""BE"" a woman either. I'm in my 40s and find the whole thing very confusing. Does being a woman mean we all go ga-ga over shoe sales? Because I sure don't! I don't know if you'd call me masculine or androgynous, but I'm certainly not feminine, not entirely anyway. I feel in my heart that I'm a woman. I grew up conflating sex and gender and I wonder if I had been born at a later date if I, too, would question my gender.

I have complicated feelings around women in tech groups. On the one hand, these spaces are one of the most comfortable places for me. I'm the only woman on my team of like 9, and one of 2 in our wider org of like 40. 

Gender is weird and complex, and I don't really feel like I fit in anywhere exactly. Men are really frustrating and annoying, and it freaks me out to think people might lump me into the same category as them. But also, I transitioned at 21 years old (3 years ago), and I don't feel like I've had a very typical ""female"" upbringing. I don't think my background really fits into either side of the gender binary.

If you're not super familiar with trans women's experiences: I don't really feel like I ever experience male privilege in the same way that cis men do, and I don't think I ever could. Navigating the world prior to 3 years ago felt more like a scene from the movie ""She's the man"" then anything else. Like I was basically forced to perform masculinity to avoid discrimination. And seeing men from that side has honestly made me a bit of a misandrist probably.

On the flip side, it's hard for me to tell what's my co-workers being sexist, and what's just the result of being early in my career. It feels like I'm constantly interrupted and talked over. It feels like I have to defend my views twice as hard. It feels like I'm never taken seriously, and I feel a lot of pressure to just be quiet honestly. I constantly feel like I have to balance my ""femininity"" with actually doing my job. It feels like I have to choose between being a leader/engineer and being a girl/woman. Like, that maybe if I was cis woman, I could have both. I might be labeled as ""bossy"", but it feels like as a trans woman, my status as a woman is up for debate, and can be revoked at any time. And the alternative isn't that I would be given the male privilege that men get. No instead, I'd just kind of be neither man nor woman.

My co-workers often invite me to women in tech events and groups. And I usually go. I've sought out a few on my own. But I feel terrified that someone there would take an issue with it, not feel comfortable with me there, or just kind of silently judge me.

Nobody's ever really acknowledged the fact that I'm trans at work. It makes me feel like everyone's too afraid to speak their mind. So I never really know if people are chill or silently judging me. I see so much media coverage about transphobia, it's hard for me to believe that people don't think all sorts of weird things about me. And I don't really have anything to say about it usually other than ""Are you chill with me?"" which just feels like it isn't okay to ask, nor would it get a proper response lol

Part of me wonders if people even know. A male co-worker of mine had a conversation about it recently and he said ""I didn't know until you said something."" And we'd known each other for a while at that point. It was in the context of him telling me he was bi though so I also wonder if he was just hitting on me.

I guess I just feel like I was never ""given permission"" to be a woman? Like I was told that if I wanted to transition that I had to BE a woman. And I don't really know what that means to be honest. There are clearly a lot of people who insist that I'm not, and there are also people who insist that I am. I'd rather be a woman than not, because I feel like there just wouldn't really be a place for me otherwise. Like ""female"" is the closer fit of the two options, and I'm not really interested in trying to carve out a new identity/group that poeple don't accept or understand. It feels like a lot of my rights are on the line too. Like my status as a woman determines whether or not I have a safe/comfortable bathroom.

And subsequently many companies have positions they call SRE ... whether or not they're anything close to what an SRE position should be ... well, that varies significantly ... even radically, among various employers/companies.  Some do it quite well, others the SRE title is just a joke/trick to get folks more interested in taking the open position.

>SRE an IT position?

Yes, but not only IT.  It's more like DevOps (and more).  But DevOps isn't really a position - though many employers slap the label on positions - DevOps is a philosophy and methodology.  So, DevOps, take Ops, add Dev ... but quite carefully and ""right"", so one can, e.g. handle infrastructure more like code and automated/automatable processes, and with all the appropriate checks and processes along the way to generally not break production - and if/when it does break from any such deployment, that it can very easily and quickly be rolled back (e.g hit the big red (virtual?) button to rollback to latest fully safe well vetted earlier release, and it's done in a matter of seconds or so).  So, DevOps also tends to continue from waterfall, into and through Agile, to frequent, or ""continuous"" deployments.  And will all appropriate controls, tests, authorizations/reviews/sign-offs, security, guard rails, etc., along the way ... so that it actually works quite well.

SRE - that takes DevOps - and adds more ... sort of.  Think of it roughly as a further and deeper technical position, but also about a half level to level up, but not management/manager position.  SRE, as the acronym implies, is primarily to engineer the reliability of the site - and has wide domain over all relevant aspects of that.  At the same time, SRE shouldn't be significant impediment to DevOps and rapid/continuous deployments, and SRE may have much overlap into DevOps, notably improving, fixing, designing, etc. DevOps infrastructure.  SRE also will often have broad domain into looking at potential issues/problems, particularly when many domains may be involved in an issue, and it may not be feasible to reasonably and quickly isolate issues/problems, without a good view of the overall systems and how they're connected and interact.  E.g. there could be feedback issues that have loops or patterns that traverse over and through many layers of different parts of infrastructure and applications, etc., and looking at any one such component in isolation may be totally impossible to diagnose the actual problem - as all the ""pieces"" may be functioning exactly as they should ... but the overall system may in fact be ""broken"" or experiencing issues.

The investigation was performed by a third party independent investigator that the company uses. I don't have much visibility into the full process, but for my part it was about an hour of chatting with their representative and explaining what I had heard. From my understanding, they had similar conversations with the accused, his manager, and other involved parties. As far as I know, in this situation it was all conversations and warnings, rather than any disciplinary action.

I wouldn't expect that you can keep your identity hidden. But I will say, at my company, retaliation is taken seriously. If people start treating you differently as a result of speaking up, then they will be in far more trouble than even the initial incident. Our HR was clear about this and it's something you could ask about too if you end up going this route.

It's possible that other men at the company will say they haven't had similar experiences when asked, but it also doesn't negate your experience. In a case of sexism, the whole point is that you are being treated differently on the basis of gender, so feedback from other men of the same gender isn't that relevant.

It also helps you forgive yourself for having trouble with tasks that are not going to be in your wheelhouse. For me, knowing I'm not 'failing' to be organized, I'm succeeding at being semi-organized, means I can be kinder to myself for forgetting a doctor's appointment.

I rely a lot on bright colors to help organize things, though my apartment seems yet to have succumbed to the 'colorization is a good proxy for organization' theory. For example, I color the tops of pill containers according to when they need to be taken (blue for night, orange for morning, purple for as-needed), so they can all be thrown into a clear bin on the table in a disorganized pile, which is an improvement on not knowing where they were at all. Sometimes I'd find one in the kitchen. Basically, since I'm never going to be good at 'everything has a place' I try to maintain more of an 'everything has a general region'.

Doodles are excellent! Da Vinci would be proud. If you can, have your doodles saying things in word bubbles that were especially important in the lecture. Also, if you need to not be doodling for something, consider getting a [fidget toy](https://smile.amazon.com/s?k=adhd+fidget+toys&ref=nb_sb_noss_1), there are a ton of different kinds on the market as people get more comfortable with kids fidgeting a little to help them stay in their seats and stay focused, and they're starting to get marketed to adults. Try getting a multi-pack that includes a [flippy chain](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BVb0PO-TL._AC_UL800_QL65_.jpg)

Figuring out the right balance of occupied attention and difficulty of task takes a bit, but if you have a kind of task you do regularly, eventually you figure something out and can get into a groove. Then you just have to make sure you don't get distracted *before* you start your routine :) Sometimes, if it's a task that requires sporadic focus, I have to make sure it's an audiobook I know well to hit that balance.

1) every so often I don't feel a difference between my brain on drugs and my brain not on drugs, and somehow my idiot self decides to just skip them that day (probably because we were taught as kids that drugging your kid out of ADHD was a big no no). *It is never a good idea, my idiot self is always wrong.* My wife can tell when I haven't taken my meds. I take [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine) of them every day 'cause it's normally used for high blood pressure, and if I skip that one everyone can tell. For the other one I'm currently switching from [vyvanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisdexamfetamine) to [concerta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate), and for either of those I don't take them on weekends. Only my wife notices lack of that one.

2) of the organizational tips I've read for us, the one that helped me the most is 'if you can't see it, you won't remember it', so my kitchen utensils are in a jar on the counter, my yarn is stuffed into open stacked baskets, and papers I'm reading are (supposed to be) printed out and sit glaring at me until I read them. I have a calendar on the fridge, I write notes on the bathroom mirror if there's something urgent for the day, and I stick up post-it notes just about everywhere. Every so often I cull them or else they aren't as useful. I make sure I remember that I cannot rely on my brain to keep important info organized and accessible, so I write notes and lists *a lot*. I have a couple of apps that keep all the notes organized and up to date across multiple devices, they're handy. Not useful when I can't find whatever device I should be using right then and just scribble info down on the corner of an envelope, but every little bit helps.

With those, I was able to go from 'massively unfocused and disorganized, smart but completely incapable of follow-through' to 'somewhat scatterbrained, needs reminders to finish stuff', which is so much more acceptable that I can function at that level. Got my PhD and everything, though I need to start organizing my job hunt.

My first ticket was to format legacy code where the linters were never properly configured. I asked questions and pointed out the fact that having me make the style rules would affect everyone's code. He told me, ""it's what you did for the code challenge, just do it"". So I did and exactly what I said would happen, happened. He chewed me out and I reached deep down to keep it together and not cry. A few days after, I showed him my code and explained my logic and then he finally agreed that I was right. 

Next big ticket is creating the logic for authentication using Passport, which has a very specific set of functions that the library needs to work. I did it and pushed my code. It sat, unreviewed for 2 weeks!!! I mentioned it in the standups and asked for him to review it. Instead, he gave me 2 more tickets. The last one, I totally f\*cked up because, again, I had no feedback from him. And since others were pushing their code, having it reviewed, and then merged, my branch kept having conflicts, which I had to rebase, resolve, and push again.

During our 1on1, he asked what can he do better and i said again, I need support. I said ""twice you've given me massive tickets that takes at least a week to close, with no support"". I said that if he could've looked over the code from the first ticket, I could have used that information to do the next ones better. I said that even sitting with me for 15 mins would help me give him what he wanted. 

And he totally ignored all of that and simply refused to acknowledge what I said. I was in the office the other day and an intern who started shortly after me was having problems with his code. He asked someone from his team for help and they walked him through the code, giving suggestions. When I looked at the damn unit test that had been giving me problems for 2 days that I asked for help with, I almost started crying at my desk =(

Since I’ve started, I’ve been working with one person, who is the same entry level title as me, but has been here for 2 years. She basically told me the project we are working on, and then essentially told me to do exactly what she did for my half of the project. She’s wonderful, but there have been issues with what she’s told me to do related to time for the application to run and storage. 

I haven’t had any real interaction with anybody senior on my team, except for on Friday when the other woman’s manager (not mine) told me my part of the application was too slow and I needed to fix it. I previously had come up with a fix because it is in fact very slow, but the woman I work with told me my fix wouldn’t work because it involves using threads. Nobody besides the woman I work most closely with has ever really looked at my code, pair programmed or anything else. 

I feel really incompetent, and like I don’t get any real help or feedback on anything. When I’ve asked my manager for feedback on my code, he tells me to ask someone else, and when I ask that person, they make it quite clear they don’t want to help (they ask me what’s the purpose of getting feedback from them). I am the only software engineer in the US, and I just feel like everyone thinks I’m a complete idiot. I really do want to be good at this, and in my mind I feel like I don’t have the right/any support.

If a diagonal line had a one-pixel gap, they wanted to know about it. It also had to be *wicked* fast. (Chip design software. A one-pixel gap could mean your ""wire"" was not actually connecting the things it was meant to connect.)

Someone on another team in the company had a graphics component that was theoretically compatible with our code. I had a meeting with the lead dev on that project and my manager's manager.

I have been feeling extremely unheard, frustrated, depressed and shitty because of the way I am treated by my 28/27yo ( let’s call him Dave) who is also an intern working in the same project.  
For some background, Dave is in his third year CS and this is his second degree. He’s had one prior internship experience. He’s a former varsity player and speaks really well. We both work on a small project under a supervisor and the managing director.
Our project tech stack is fairly new and there isn’t lot of info about it online so you’d have to really understand the large code base to get started. Dave had a problem with navigating the code base and when I would find info about relevant features he would try to portray my research as something irrelevant. It seemed as if he didn’t like that I made progress and he didn’t . We would have daily check ins and he would message me 20 min before the meeting, get updates from me and present it as something “we did together” when it was all me. At times it felt like he didn’t like the progress I made and would often speak for me during meetings and assign me task as if he was my boss. After a few times I stopped responding to him right before the meeting or gave him partial info. 
Things got really uncomfortable when he had to learn some thing from me. For eg: when I tried to explain that FE and BE have different ports and that he was only exposing the FE port. He said, “ I’m pretty sure it’s only one. Based on the course we learnt at school local host is the only port.” idk how to respond to that ignorance. 
More things like that. I have to go out of my way to prove that my code works and my approach is the optimal and this is stressing me out a lot. I have to prove facts to him just to make progress and it’s slowing the entire project down.
When i debugged an issue, he would respond with comments like “did you actually solve it” and when i presented a concern, he would talk over me or say that it’s irrelevant and I’d have to spend hours fixing the issue in the last min
The worst part is my supervisor seems to put him on a pedestal. I’ve noticed that when I say something my supervisor doesn’t list but when Dave says the same thing he’s more responsive. 

Dave also doesn’t work a lot. I’ve heard him mention how he spends 2 hrs per day in this internship when I have been working my ass off everyday to complete the project. The worst thing is nobody seems to hold him accountable. 
And recently I’ve found out that he makes 5 dollars per hour more than me for the same positions and he doesn’t know shit. ( I had to show him how to use the google dev tools and how api requests work and many more basic things)
 When I tried to negotiate my offer with the company prior to the internship they said that “based on my experience this amount was justified and that it was a flat rate for everyone” but Apparently not for Dave. This is extremely frustrating bc he treats me very poorly, i have to babysit him so that our project makes some progress and the company thinks he’s more valuable
 
I am not sure what to do atm. I wanted to bring this up to my manager but I don’t want to be labelled as someone difficult to work with or dramatic. I am looking for a return offer but at this point I’m not sure anymore.

I know, I know, ""being colorblind rhetoric isn't the answer!!11"" and maybe as a broader approach it's not.

""Which one should I call for an interview today?"" overt or subconscious bias is going to nudge that hiring manager to call Brad, not Carlos. Brad, not Elizabeth. And if Brad says ""nope"", it will be Elizabeth, not Lakeisha.

Then even in the interview stage, Elizabeth ""just seems unprofessional/bossy/timid/less experienced"" and Carlos just ""isn't a good fit, I really clicked with Brad the most"".

When the majority of the industry set their standards in a way that preferences some people (eg white cis middle class men)over others, then it is entirely appropriate to question that. This isn’t a “lowering”, it is a different definition to ensure other things are also valued. Valuing diversity raises the standards imho.

If you believe that a CS degree is absolutely crucial (I don’t), then an employer can always have a pipeline that sponsors diverse people to get that degree. (I have two siblings whose employers supported them to get MBAs, not due to diversity but just because many companies are willing to do this for certain roles - which tend to be occupied by fairly privileged people).

However this idea that everyone needs not just a degree but a degree in a specialised field before they can even get an entry level job has really evolved over the past 30years or so, while prior to that there was much more expectation that employers would hire & train people based on their potential, people would learn on the job. 

Have people in the last 30yrs suddenly become incapable of learning outside of an institutional setting?  Of course not: we live in an era where there is much greater access to learning via the internet, people often start learning programming using online resources, it is no longer all locked up in universities. 

Choosing to hire based on a persons skills (as evaluated by code challenge, interviews, etc) rather than automatically prioritising a degree (which can be bought nowadays, cheating is rife) doesn’t mean standards are “lowered”.

Further, for decades now there has been a tech skill shortage without enough CS grads to fill the demand, so of course we need to consider other ways of educating/training people. 

This is particularly the case when it comes to career changers - the majority of bootcamp grads come with years of work experience from their first career, often hold a degree in another field, and bring transferable skills with them.

I joined a small startup (~5 people) so I expected that there would be more women. The startup definitely wasn’t hostile to women and it seemed like a great environment, and women were interviewed often so it seemed like we would probably eventually get a critical mass of women.

Then my mentor in the company left and the leadership team hired one new guy. The guy was a super experienced industry veteran but he treated me differently and it seemed like he hadn’t ever worked with a woman at his or a similar level before in his life (wouldn’t be surprised, I work in semiconductor industry where this seems to be the norm). Right off the bat he treated me like a child, diminished my accomplishments and contributions, slowly blocked me from projects (even ones I was originally in charge of), and started to limit my responsibilities (and consequently my growth opportunities). He preferred to work with people who managed projects in the most disorganized, impractical given our capabilities, and ego-driven way. Projects started failing but others were promoted within the company despite the carelessness and failures, and despite my track record of engineering integrity and success on similar projects. My old mentor would be disgusted at some of the current practices going on. 

My new boss wasn’t as invested in my career growth. People started taking credit for my contributions. I started being talked over and my (experienced) opinion being ignored in meetings. I was assigned all of the background work to keep the company functioning, but none of the growth/visibility projects. And everyone was in on it.. it seemed like it was an open secret that projects were to be assigned to me and the successful outcomes attributed to other members of the team. And as a result, I felt the most stifled I have ever felt in my life. My mental health suffered and I am still working on trying to get over workplace paranoia after all the manipulation. 

Thankfully I used all the extensive experience I got there to find another job, quit, and now I am almost out of there. Once they realized their “secret golden goose” was leaving, all the drama ensued. They begged me to stay and brought out all the manipulation and false promises. But in the process of all this, I found out they gave much less experienced employees who joined the startup later way more stock options. I am still dealing with the devastation at being taken advantage of to the extent that I was, from people I once looked up to and respected.

All this to say, I don’t recommend it. This is just my story and it is a fresh wound so I am probably pretty biased.

I have been doing lots of code reviews as I too find them very helpful. Since I've started this, I've felt a lot more open to comments on my PRs. Before I used to dread opening PR for review but now I don't feel as nervous. 

This ticket has been going on for so long though, and with time it has really affected my self-esteem. I'm not sure I can go through this with this new sprint that literally just started. 

I ran the script last week, guaranteed it worked fine  and even was asking about when to remove the dead  code from the script (this makes me cringe when thinking about it now!).
Then a peer pointed out that the script, put information in tables for payers that weren't supposed to be messed with. 
So, I've been working on fixing that. This evening, I realised that there were actually many, like MANY errors on the logs from the first run. That meant that all the tables I said were filled with the information needed, weren't actually in the first place because of a timeout issue. Now, I have to fix the tables that had the wrong information AND run the script again for the tables that don't have the information at all.
I sent a message to my manager and peer right away explaining the situation. I don't think they appreciated getting work messages on an evening ( I hate doing that to them) but I just knew that if I didn't make the issue known, I wouldn't be able to sleep.

Shopify has themes you can adjust using JS and Liquid to get it to your liking, so that can cut down on a significant amount of dev time. A fairer rate for custom code would be somewhere between $40-$75/hr.

Come up with a SOW to set expectations for the work to be completed. That will help you break down the tasks and estimate the time for each task.

Be in charge, show confidence and authority.  If someone insists on lashing out, hang up or walk away.  You’re not a babysitter you’re a professional.  Perfect the technique of quiet staring followed by walking away.  Dealing with adult tantrums is both a skill and an art.  I’ve worked with 60 year old babies before.  

Also learn to hear just the words and not the tone.  Filter out unhelpful remarks and look for the ones that help you identify the issue.  Ask questions and filter out the bluster.  Some people don’t know how to control their frustration so you can be a calming influence if you don’t lose your own cool.  If they can’t calm down, you can’t get the info you need to help.

Then call their managers and let them know you can’t help them if they can’t be professional about the situation.

Tech is complicated.  Things fail in crazy weird places and that requires good analytical focus to debug and resolve.  If throwing baby tantrums worked they wouldn’t need you.

One thing you could consider doing is look into any Constructive Confrontation classes.  Learn to tell people bad news and handle blowback.  Learn to hang up the phone and offer to call back when they can hold themselves together.  You can protect your boundaries and be of service only when you can get good accurate information about the issue so you know where to start looking.  You can’t do this if people are behaving badly.

This happens in many places besides tech support. Learning to handle these kinds of behaviors early will help you move quickly and make progress to solve problems.  Putting tantrums in their place, calming down upset people, that happens EVERYWHERE, not just tech.  Tech adds the extra dimension of confusion and frustration because most people are using tools they don’t really understand.  You can empathize (or not) but, like any stressed out emergency worker, you need to look past the rage and tears to find what’s going on or you can’t begin to treat it.  If you can do that, then the rest is the “easy” part - finding what’s wrong, fixing it, or communicating ETAs and reasons.  Remember - YOU didn’t break it.  YOU are there to help.  Emphasize that and most people will back down.

And if they’re still pissy, walk away until they can behave.  You don’t get paid enough to take abuse, and there are plenty of other jobs for real professionals out there.  They can let you help, or you can walk.

Build yourself an emergency fund from your first jobs so while they’re screaming you can decide if you’re better off looking for another job, since in this case, Money is Time.

Yes. I wear PPE. However, just because a chemical may not require a certain level for safe handling with skin/human biology does not mean it is clothing safe at that level particularly over the long term. Nor does the fact you're doing some sort of science that you can do in a suit mean that all scientists are or that they're not being sufficiently safe if their work is harder on fabric.

When you work with a lot of strong acids or bases (or sensitizing materials like say photo developing fluid or even putrid things like cadavers), these chemicals can still get into fabric despite lab coats through evaporation/aerosolization in a way that causes small holes in fabric upon washing in the former category or a lingering scent. The necessity of using bleach in sterilization/cleaning of lab surfaces and floors or cell culture can easily wreck pants that aren't intended to be covered by lab coats. It's a lot easier to take splashing bleach on a 20 dollar pair of old navy jeans than a 50 dollar pair of tailored slacks. Further, even if chemically you can keep your closet safe, or you may be working with a hazardous material that necessitates more frequent laundering (for instance when I worked with feline herpesvirus and had cats, I did laundry every day i handled live virus so as to not even risk my cats) which also wears down clothes and makes dry-clean only options impossible. 

Suits may be something people who don't spend 60 hours a week in lab have enforced upon your workplace. A lot if times in industry, you're in a repetitive, controlled environment doing a very small range of tasks. So maybe if all you do is repetitive assays with salt-based reagents or something you'd be fine. But that doesn't mean it's the only way, or even the most reasonable for all of science.

There were scores of comments regarding male peers who did stupid things - and one comment about a female engineer who did something stupid. The comment about the female engineer received a reply citing a study about how women, due to their gender, struggle more with programming due to inherent qualities of their gender (I’m paraphrasing, bottom line is he cited a study and used it to say the coworker did something stupid because she was a woman).

I responded “if someone cited a study every time a man did something stupid, we’d have studies on every other comment here.” (For example (
[just hypothetical] men are on average more impulsive, maybe that makes them worse programmers?)

I got angry replies for this. Apparently, because I pointed out that coincidentally a gender-based study was only cited for the woman who did something stupid, I was anti-science and anti-fact, I wanted to suppress this man’s right to speak, I believed that men and women were exactly the same. Etc etc. I tried explaining further that this implies stupid men are stupid because of who they are as individuals, but a stupid woman represents her entire gender. Ie men are allowed to be judged on their own merits as human beings, a woman’s actions must represent her gender. They didn’t want to hear any of it.

It was hilariously tragic. Just pointing out their possible bias (really? Citing gender as a reason for a stupid action on the one woman-centered incident in a sea of other stupid actions?) instantly made them defensive and fearful.

Thinking nothing of it I go, but that’s when it starts to get creepy. He was meeting friends in Dallas, TX and was not just driving through my town. He flew down to Houston (4 hours away from Dallas) and rented a car to drive up to where I live before driving to Dallas. He only lives a three hour drive in the opposite direction of Dallas so this was WAY out of the way for him. He decides to stay in town the night and is asking me to show him around which I decline because I have things to do, but I agree to get lunch again the next day because I am feeling guilty. 


The next day I bring my boyfriend with me to lunch because I can tell something is up. I think he is finally gone after this but he messages me later that night that he is still in town for another night because he forgot his laptop here and asks to meet again tomorrow which is a Monday. I tell him no I have school and work and he begins to beg to just come talk to me for 10 minutes. 
Me being pissed and stupid I agree to meet him briefly in a public place for a few minutes while I grab coffee. He tells me that he fell in love with me over the summer and thinks that he might have a chance with me. The worst part was when he mentioned that he still wants kids and that I would be great for him being that I’m only 21. I obviously told him no and to please not ever talk to me again, but I can’t shake the feeling that I did something wrong to make him think this. 


This was my first experience being in a corporate environment and now I am about to graduate and start my career elsewhere (thank god I rejected my offer at that company) but I am terrified that I was not acting professional enough or may have given other people the wrong impression. Is this what my whole career is going to be like? I understand an office crush but this was beyond creepy from someone who was assigned to help me and have my back. Now I feel so uncertain of myself and am afraid to start my new job. I don’t know if I can trust the men I will work with.

Can you realistically complete the move and afford to do the monthly travel?  I would be tempted to prioritize either the move or the job search, knock that out, and then the next steps. Now that you have a year under your belt, run your eye over the last edit of the resume - see if you can update it to leverage that experience.

Is there anything about your current role that could be changed to get make staying until you have two solid years of experience behind you?  Is it the pay, the tech, the environment or simply the physical location - and are there any improvements to be made?  Do you have a mentor, if not I would strongly suggest some networking and finding someone you feel comfortable with.

Don't lose hope, your resume is obviously being read and gathering interest. Many are job hunting currently, and you have already shown you can transition and are adaptable - the right fit will come along. If you attend any conferences (virtual or otherwise) many have resume reviews by other community members.  Go easy on yourself, treat yourself kindly, if you can I would suggest taking a step back for a week - to decompress, decide on the next moves and avoid the 'analysis paralysis' with so much on your plate!

I am at the end of a Computer Science bachelor's programme and will look for a job after I finished it.

I have been doing some jobs while I was a student and I learned to program a bit during my studies. However, I never program for fun or have a lot of experience. The truth is that I just did these studies to get a secure, well-paid job and not because I am passionate about it.

I should also mention that I am a bit older than most people would be at this point: 32.

Despite those student jobs that were in programming, I feel like I know very little and am not really proficient in any programming language. I regret not having worked for longer during my studies.

Now that I will be looking for my first real job, I feel pretty inadequate. In student jobs, the employers and colleagues probably expect less, and if it is only because you earn less.

I feel like if I should apply for a specific, real job, I would like it to start in a couple of months so I have time to get into the programming language, required tools, etc. And I feel like I should ask for a relatively low salary so people don't expect as much from me.

I know, however, that you should always sell yourself as best as you can and not show any insecurity. It is classic imposter syndrome, I guess.

From a financial point of view, my plan (starting a little later and ""practicing"" first) would work.

Is it a good idea to do it like this?

Or should I just ""go for it"" and risk sucking at my first job and getting fired after a while?I feel like that would mess with my self-esteem even more.

When making my decision, on the issue of gender inequity and diversity issues I considered :
- every industry has sexism, it just displays itself in different ways
- I’d worked in industries with decent number of women yet power and culture was still dominated by men, the inequity was subtle rather than blatant yet in some ways it made it harder to identify and point out, creating far more self doubt when trying to understand why things were unnecessarily hard
- looking at industries that have a high % of women, like child care or teaching, there is still systemic sexism of poor pay, limited options, and men entering these professions are fast tracked and disproportionately hold power positions. 
- even if there is a gender pay gap in tech and opportunity gap, the skills shortage and market rates mean I’ll earn more than & have more opportunities than in many other industries
- what is really important is to seek out the best in the industry, the companies that have a good workplace culture that will fit, and avoid any that send up red flags.

There is a world of difference between a healthy male culture and a toxic male culture. 

If you find a company that hires good people who treat others with respect, collaborate well, are progressively minded, you can have a good experience.

I am new to the industry, 6 months on the job, I am the only woman on my team and only really see women in department and company level meetings and events, or if there is a cross company initiative (workshopping company values, recruitment, etc). 

My team is great, really supportive, appreciate my contributions, and my tech lead has told me he thinks I’ll be ready for promotion to intermediate software engineer in a couple more months - there’s just one skill I have to learn and practice to get there. This will be quite fast promotion (9 months entry level junior to intermediate). 

I am not a person of colour so I can’t comment on whether there is racism, however we have plenty of people in the company from different cultural and racial backgrounds, particularly in tech roles, and the founders immigrated as children from an Asian country.

The kind of gender inequity in my company is more about blindspots. I’d say pretty much all the guys would be of the view “it would be nice to have more women and better gender equality”, they just aren’t aware of how to address it. So decisions can sometimes be made without having female input, and stuff is more designed with men in mind. Like a go-carting team bonding event, having health/wellbeing sessions (run by an external company) run by a man who has a male perspective, some
decisions in recruitment that unintentionally lean in to systemic inequity (if prefer grad candidates with a tech degree, which are 80% male, will more likely hire a man than if open to bootcamp grads which are more diverse), men like to banter and joke/smack-talk each other.

However that didn’t stop them from hiring me (I’m a bootcamp grad, and a woman) and the company does want to improve on this and has been open to my feedback. I started out self taught (which is a slow path!), then did a bootcamp. 

What is really clear is that as soon as you have experience in this industry, you can vote with your feet. The skills shortage means you’ll have many job opportunities and if you are not happy with the company you’re at, you can find a new job easily. 

On the topic of thinking outside the box and other qualities: I’d suggest writing down your wish list of qualities and then starting to research the companies that seem to meet them. This process will help when you are ready to look for jobs to find the kind of employer that will be a good fit. tech is more like an overlay than a pure industry, there’s fintech, edtech, health tech, etc - so there will be companies that are what you want, but there will also be others that still have all the problems of the corporate culture you’re trying to get away from. Being able to recognise the difference will help steer you in the right direction.

Though I had been studying on my own for 5 months prior to the program I still struggled a lot to keep up.

The worst was post-course. The job search is brutal. You really have to keep putting yourself out there and keep learning, and there is a lot of rejection. It requires a lot of hustle and grit.

So it is very hard, but can be very rewarding. When I did it there were not that many bootcamps, now there are soooooooooo many!

I know that you're all paying through the nose for your education, so you are a customer to the university. You paid money to be educated and then assessed fairly and to a high standard.

Anyone else?,oik6u4,,"Hi y'all, I just had a really weird experience with a recruiter and thought I'd post here. I won't say the name of the company as I might end up working there, but I wanted to know how common this is and whether it's a red flag. 

On to the story: I'm currently applying for a new job and one of the positions I am applying for is at a small company I used to work for part-time. I had a great experience working there, met some great people, but my contract wasn't renewed so that's why I moved on. 

I had an initial phone screen with the recruiter on Friday, and I couldn't stop thinking about it all weekend. The recruiter was... oddly rude and condescending, is the only way I can think to put it. A couple of things that happened during our phone call:

* The recruiter was an hour late to the phone call, and didn't give any apology. I sent a couple quick emails, something like ""Hi, sorry we missed each other! Let me know if I mixed up the time on my end. Looking forward to connecting soon!"" All I got back in response was: ""Please call me at your earliest convenience.""
* I mentioned during the phone call that I had exchanged emails with the company president, since we had gotten to know each other when I worked there previously. As soon as I mentioned this, the recruiter started to interrogate me about this exchange and I had to re-hash everything that was said in our two emails exchanged. It sounded like I had gotten the president in trouble and wasn't supposed to have done that.
* I asked whether there were any plans to re-open the office (closed during COVID) since my apartment can be noisy and it's not easy for me to work from home. She very condescendingly told me that it was ""clearly stated on the job description that it was remote only"" (uh, okay. The job description also contained obvious copypasta so it wasn't clear) and then again interrogated me about my home situation.

I'm honestly not sure what to do with this information. All of the recruiters I've worked with in the past (and I've applied to a lot of jobs) have been super polite. I feel like this isn't concrete enough to bring a formal complaint (mostly just ""I felt bad when recruiter said X with Y tone"") but I'm wondering if it's a red flag that maybe I should move on from this job posting.

Most often feedback is valid and coming from a good place. But all too often the way it is said can feel very humiliating or down right condescending. It’s hard to separate out the two.

Asking questions often helps get to the root of the feedback. In many cases this is valid.

A strategy I use is to always first acknowledge that the feedback is valid and good. But then, if I don’t necessarily agree with it, state my case, but always positioning their feedback generally being the right direction we ultimately want to head it. It makes them feel heard and validated while keeping your approach in tact.

*“I mean I generally agree that that approach is the better way to go and I even explored it in version 1. The issues we ran into with it were XXX and YYY.

First up, GHC is over, so we've disabled the annual automod controls around discussions of GHC until next year. And that's especially important this year, because the regulars of the community will know already that we had some fiery conversations over the last week about what happened at GHC. 

### The conversation must continue

One particular thread became a proxy location to hash out what had occurred at GHC, and as difficult as it was to read and engage in (especially with all the transphobe sealions and community invaders trying to distract the conversation), it *was* a conversation that needs to take place. 

And unfortunately, while the moderators were working to keep the conversation as-civil-as-as-reasonable, while also allowing folks to vent very well-founded frustration over the invasion of our spaces at GHC, while being further invaded in this space, the **reddit admins** decided to step in and remove the thread entirely, as well as dozens of comments within the thread. 

### Reddit bowed to TERFs but we won't let it stand

So the reddit community team saw all the false reports of sexism and misogyny coming in from transphobes on the thread last week, and decided that even though the moderators were being extremely active in the thread, it warranted removal under reddit's content policies.

We didn't take that lying down. Thankfully, I have a position of privilege as a moderator on the Reddit Mod Council, and I was able to get the attention few moderators are able to get from the admins on this site. They apologized to us for the mistake, and have restored [the thread]( https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/comments/16vkyl5/what_are_yalls_opinions_on_cis_men_crashing/) (which remains locked, by the choice of our mods).


So we want to let /u/Free_Ad_2780 know that the removal of that thread was not done at the request of, or in cooperation with, the moderators of this subreddit. It was done without our knowledge or approval, and we've managed to get reddit to restore it with an apology attached for its removal. 

### /r/GirlsGoneWired supports diversity and inclusion

A lot of these conversations have been about how can we support our under-represented communities in these events, and protect them from being exploited by over-represented groups. 

What happened at GHC was cis men exploiting a resource and taking it from the people who it was designed to help. The poster of the thread linked above related the inability to access those resources to situations where organizations are trying to support racial diversity, but are unable to prevent people from non-marginalized races to access them.

This is what /r/GirlsGoneWired was created for. 

To be clear, if you come here and think that you can Matt Walsh it up by saying ""you can't excluse cis men from an event because you can't distinguish them from trans women"", you're a transphobe, that's a lazy argument, and you don't belong here. 

I am a trans woman, and I built this community along with my cis friends, and you will not stop us from being successful. We will ban you, and I will enjoy it.

### Reddit is not in this with us

Honestly, as much as I love creating communities for women, and as much as I love banning transphobes and misogynists, as I said several months ago, reddit is not here for us, and I just have so much trouble finding the energy to give this community the attention it deserves.

You all might be shocked to learn that I sent out invitations to a half dozen applicants for a moderator role, and none of them accepted. Only one even acknowledged they'd received the invite.

I don't blame them. The reddit app absolutely sucks, and I fully believe that they had no idea I sent them an invitation. 

Thankfully, some of you are quite active in the modmail with this team, and I decided to invite one particular moderator on a lark, and they've been kicking ass in the comments since they came on. Thank you /u/PhoenicianKiss.

I don't have faith that reddit is the forever-home for a community like ours. This week, reddit's automations failed our community. They accepted the will of the TERFs, failed to understand the nuanced arguments of the conversation, and overrode the will of the moderators and this community, and damaged our ability to discuss these events while they were pertinent. 

### Let's talk

So we're opening the floor for conversation -- this community needs mods, so let's talk about mods. I'd love to pass the baton on this subreddit, but I don't want to leave you all unguarded from malicious actors, because without my tenure and connections as a moderator of over a decade, we wouldn't have been able to restore that thread like we did today. We wouldn't have gotten an apology from reddit. But I also don't have the time and energy to give this community what it needs, and I don't want to leave it in PhoenicianKiss's lap and nope out. 

And let's talk about what happened at GHC, and with these other orgs and events. How do we protect women's spaces while ensuring they remain inclusive to trans and non-binary identities?

And above all else, **please use the report button and modmail**, it's the best way to notify us mods that something is up that needs addressing.

I could be wrong but either way it’s clear through their behavior that they don’t see you as an equal. It’s a sticky situation with no clear or guaranteed resolution, and I’m sorry that you’re in it.

Definitely try talking to them and point out that regardless of the meaning to them, it’s demeaning to you and doesn’t adequately set the tone of your working relationship, which is presumably as working peers on equal footing.

If their behavior doesn’t change you will have to make the decision of either escalating and continuing to push the issue (which will put your relationship with them and the company as a whole at risk) or trying to adapt yourself (which can put your own mental health at risk.)

I'm relatively new to my career in tech and I'm still figuring out what's acceptable professional behavior. (As a side note, I'm also an instructor at a local college and I'm pretty confident about what's acceptable in that context, but somehow the workplace behavior for a company seems slightly different.)


&nbsp;

  
My problem is two-fold: I have two dismissive coworkers who call me ""dear"" when I ask them to do things. The dismissive part is something I've brought up to my manger before. I am supposed to be leading a project, and two of my coworkers keep trying to leave me out of all of the work and planning. My manager is aware of this issue and has addressed it once. I'll need him to address it again, though.


&nbsp;


The other issue, the reason I'm posting, is that I've needed to be more assertive in order to not get left out. A couple of female coworkers keep calling me ""dear"" when I am assertive (and I'm really careful to be assertive, not aggressive). Whenever I ask them to do things, I'm either ignored or they acknowledge with something along the lines of, ""sure, dear."" (Sometimes after the ""sure, dear"" they will follow through; sometimes not.)


&nbsp;

It feels very condescending when they call me ""dear"", as if I'm a child and they are patting me on the head. At the very least, I consider this to be sexist because they don't refer to any of my male coworkers this way. I have not brought the use of the word ""dear"" up to management yet because I'd like to understand where it's coming from first. If it's actually meant to be patronizing, I believe speaking with management or HR is appropriate. If it's a common cultural thing in India, I would rather speak with the coworkers directly (before escalating) to let them know I'm not ok with being called ""dear"".

I'm in my 50s.  Thirty yrs ago, as a graduate student in another discipline, I took a six-month intro programming course at a large state university.  We used ADA.  The course was considered difficult.  (The cs major was too popular, so undergrads had to apply for it. The two-quarter programming course was the weed-out tool.)

I earned a nearly perfect score in the course, but at the end I still didn't know how to program.  I could do all of the assignments and solve all of the test questions, but if you'd asked me to actually write a program for you I wouldn't know where to start.

My nephews went to college together.  One became a programmer; the other went into finance.  When I told them this story, the finance one said Yes!  That exact same thing happened to him.  He took the programming course with his brother, earned an A, but didn't know how to program at the end of it.

In this research, I found that bootcamps tend to have very diverse students in their community, which was pretty insightful overall. All of these students were beginning their new careers at different levels, yet were able to still be successful in landing a job in the tech field fairly quickly (6-12 months).

Even though the coding bootcamps I've worked with have proven to be a valuable gateway into tech opportunities, I don't think coding bootcamps are for everyone.

These skills need active work the same as tech skills, to become better and more comfortable, I would say they are actually a bit harder to learn and take more time so don’t expect fast results. The good news is that no one else necessarily notices (this is more about how you feel than how others see you, as you already get reviewed highly).

You could work with a psychologist or coach to work towards this goal. They would give you some guidance and help keep you on track and someone to report your attempts and progress to, to feel supported and aid reflection and motivation.

Or there are some classic books like “how to win friends and influence people” (or more modern takes) that help demystify human behaviour and some of the techniques you could try.

Asking questions, approaching people with curiosity and empathy, getting in the habit of ice breaker small talk as a starting point (this is why men often follow sport even if they’re not interested in it, because it is commonly a way to start a conversation with another man; talking about the weather; commenting that you like someone’s shoes, or t-shirt if it is related to pop culture, asking what they did on the weekend, or if they have plans for next weekend…)

In a work situation, when meeting colleagues you don’t know well you could ask them how long they’ve been with the company, where they worked before, how does it compare, how did they get into the industry, etc. Most people will respond well to questions, and those with decent social skills will also ask you questions back, that will give you something to talk about. Show interest, have good listening skills (though that can be hard when you are nervous), be non judgmental, and people will start to relax. 

If people seem a bit nervous or socially anxious themselves, it can be good to reveal something personal and vulnerable about yourself, to put them at ease and know it’s a safe space to be themselves. This depends on whether you want this level of connection in a workplace and if the people and workplace are a good fit for it (don’t in a toxic workplace).

Another guy came in after 1 month and I start to get undermined. 3 weeks in, I heard him tell the PO as I was coming back from the toilet at one of our company parties that he had no respect for my skills and didn't think I was technically sound. Fair judgement except that the message spread and the PO he spoke to, who usually asks for my opinion on things, stopped doing so. (I wish he'd told me because I genuinely look for feedback). My confidence took a big hit and I stopped speaking in meetings (my fault) and did a very average job for 1 year. I decided to change roles when covid hit, got my PSM and moved to agile/ scrum technical PM. Got some decent feedback since the role change, and was satisfied until the PO left and I was offered to take over a portion of his work, and heard my manager who I'd been trusting with my insecurities on speaking up, told a group of people, ""of course she won't be able to fill his shoes"" (he's been ignoring me since and sometimes doesn't respond to my hello if I see him next to the coffee machine at work).

Recently, I ran into my coach from my initial days and my current manager, and when he said ""isn't she a good performer"" and my manager looked away and said ""hmm...she's been learning"".

My in office experience was pretty awkward with a bunch of people from different branches who I didn’t know or work with, and most of the people I did work with being in different offices across the country. I almost always ate lunch alone and I haven’t really gone back since the pandemic. I think I could have made some office friends but the effort was too high for me to bother with.

I would expect less awkwardness actually seeing people on your team so hopefully you get that!

As for saying hi in the hallways maybe just smile at people and see what happens.

Also your office should host various networking and/or team building events so I recommend going to those as a more organic way to get to know people vs just sharing office space.

Good luck and try not to be too put off if you encounter general awkwardness. It’s just kind of a common thing in the tech sector and in my experience people aren’t trying to be rude, more like they are unsure and wanting to be polite and not distract others.

I was hired to help with customer support and training, but my role has morphed as we have doubled in size to managing our support tasks. I am mainly doing project management type work with our support tasks -making sure things are assigned and completed, working as the communicator to our customers to help gather the details of customer issues, but also communicate back when they are resolved, as well as answering our support help ticket platform. 

My direct supervisor in my last two one on one's has told me directly that I'm not qualified for my role, that someone more technical should be managing, and that he doesn't think I belong in this role. The first time he told me this he said that an employee (who is known to be unreliable at communication and accomplishing tasks) should have received my role but hadn't shown enough initiative, so I filled it. 

In the last month I've had mostly negative feedback from my him including, one of my one on one's was suppose to be 30 mins but went for nearly two hours in which I was asked the same questions over and over in different ways. It felt so degrading and I qA exasperated by the end of it. I'm feeling really frustrated to be continually told in not qualified by the person who supervises me. It seems that he is doing this because he'd prefer I do the role he had a vision for, rather than what it morphed into.

Despite him telling me I'm unqualified he is not providing evidence of where I'm doing a poor job. I've met with our CEO who about some of the mixed messages I've been getting and affirmed that he wants me in this position and that I'm doing a good job. I also have metrics to support the work I'm doing.  

I've never had such negative feedback from a supervisor. Sometimes I wonder if it has anything to do with gender in that I'm the only women in position of management. But really don't have anything to support that feeling, other than he has said that other women in the company are not doing well at their jobs because they have a confidence issue and him continuing to disempower me without evidence.  It probably more has to do with his perception of what he wants my job to be vs. what I have been tasked with, but none the less, it's making me angry.

Interrupting is annoying, but someone who won't admit when they are wrong and blames other people will endanger all the work you need to do with them. I agree this isn't unusual to encounter someone like this. Maybe he's an OK person, but I wouldn't want to build software with him.

This bias of 'if a woman has gotten this far is CS she must be pretty special/amazing' is held by both male and female supervisors. Which is a shame! As it means mediocre men get a free pass when it comes to most work whereas we're expected to live up to impossible standards placed on us by being a minority that has gotten far. 

However, as with your situation, I think female supervisors might be more guilty than male when it comes to holding these expectations.

We are a group of 4 girls in computer science and have recently created an android app to help people achieve their goals and encourage each other by sharing their progress and giving cute stickers. Our personal struggles with motivation during COVID lockdowns and social isolation inspired us to find a new way to bring people closer together. Change must come from within, and this app sets up the right environment for personal development.

With Goal Goat, we want to change the way that goal planning works by providing a safe space to talk about one’s innermost dreams. Unlike a typical goal-setting app, we wanted to experiment with the idea of incorporating a social media element that would allow everyone to share their goals with a wider community and hopefully cheer on others in their own pursuits in life.

You can try it out here if you’re interested. The app is in beta and in active development. This is your chance to shape the direction that Goal Goat takes in the future. Let us know how you like it!

You can grind a meeting to dead halt with a little ingenuity, all the while appearing to be trying to do exactly as requested. 


Learned that trick from a work colleague who had been in the military.  He didn't drink coffee, but, as person at the bottom of the pecking order he was pestered to make it.  He (knowingly) dumped the coffee *into the pot*, filled it with water, and set it on the heating element.  


He didn't get asked a second time.


The other trick: ""Sure, I would be happy to take on that task!  Which priority should I drop to make room for it? "" (Said in a cheerful, upbeat,"" I'm a team player"" voice).


The important part is not doing or saying anything that has a whiff of insubordination.


On a particularly bad day with an incompetent director, I did once blurt out: ""Two weeks ago we mapped out a six month project for my team.  Today you want us to do a new multi-month project.

I know you asked for guidance on internal transfers but imma tell you my strategies for dealing with assholes in the workplace. 

- involve someone else on your team in the conversation. I’ve included teammates in conversations with assholes very frequently. Especially if you have a buddy at work who is okay with just existing in the conversation. People behave better when there is someone else watching. 

- read “Why Does He Do That?” by Lundy Bancroft. It’s about abusive men, but the behaviors translate to the work world very well. It has helped me with men at work immensely. 

- don’t let them see you get angry. I get angry… a lot… but don’t let them see it. They will label you as emotional and suddenly they’ll be too “worried” about your feelings to give honest feedback. This has gotten easier for me working and off camera. They don’t see or hear my angry words and rude gestures. I also have gotten very good at a “happy voice” that I throw on when people piss me off. I feel a bit like Dolores umbridge, but it gets the job done. 

- get a good therapist and mental health team. They can help you stay stable and grounded. My therapist has called out my warped view many times and it helps with perspective.

But also I want to share that so far both of the roles I’ve had in analytics, I was a little bit “inexperienced” but still given a chance (because I was the best candidate they had) and I’ve thrived.

Meaning if you have 50% of the qualifications then you probably have 100% of what they really need.

I used to have that feeling of anger and unfairness towards certain coworkers, and my theory is that it's kind of a ""natural"" thing for people transitioning out of CS into the workplace.

But your responsibility in the workplace is a total shift in perspective - to make the team as successful as possible.  

I had to actively undo that comparison, expectation, and bitterness and it did make me less angry. (""Not my circus, not my monkeys."") But even better, it made me into a good coworker at my next job.  

I imagined what it would be like to have the roles reversed, if I got a new coworker that was naturally able to do 10x more than me and who didn't respect me because of it. That would suck! I would want them to be nice to me and help me if I asked. At the end of the day, some people are burned out or have things in their life that don't let them prioritize work 100%.

Someone gave me this advise and I found it helpful. As a career changer, you have years of experience in another field. You have spent time and become good at what you do. You are probably used to people coming to you for help. But now you are starting again and you will be in the position of being a beginner and feeling quite helpless at times. It’s ok, it’s normal. You shall also eat lots of humble pie. The taste of humble pie can become quite awful and exhausting.

And then this is my own personal advice. Making a career change is super scary and it can fill you full of doubt. Part of the way you may be trying to work through your feelings is to try to figure out if you will be successful in your venture. If you knew you would succeed you would feel better. However, you can’t predict the future. You can lose a lot of energy and cause yourself a lot of stress thinking this way. It’s better to frame it as “do I want to be here? Do I want to do this?” If the answer is yes, then just give it your best.

That being said, my experience in tech (at least in FAANG) has been that the sexism and racism actually get talked about, vs. just ignored as in the other industries/institutions I've been in. Both FAANG companies I've worked for had very vocal groups actively working against bias of all kinds. I'm able to talk openly about my experiences, vs. being told to keep quiet in other industries. Personally I much prefer being in a company that pays attention to these issues rather than pretending that they don't exist.

Another thing to keep in mind is that ""Silicon Valley culture"" will likely be very different by the time you graduate or are eligible for internships, particularly if the current trends in remote work continue. With even big companies moving toward large portions of the workforce being remote, I think some of these cultural issues will become less relevant or at least less dominant.

I'll quote: ""Harassment becomes unlawful where ... the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive."" Individual incidents that are too small to take to HR will still create that hostile work environment, which is illegal and your company is liable for it.

It's up to you how you want to proceed, but at a minimum I would start documenting those incidents.  You may never decide to report it, but you'll want that documentation in-hand in case that ever happens. Depending on how private your work email is I recommend sending yourself or someone you trust an email describing an incident every time it happens - then it's documented on the company's own servers.  For paranoia's sake, also save a copy of the email file (not just the text) to your personal records.

It sounds like this is a culture problem at your company, so other people are likely also being harassed.  Even if you never bring this up with HR yourself, having that documented evidence on hand could be VERY helpful to one of your coworkers if they're forced into reporting.

Luckily I haven’t had many instances where coworkers are passive aggressive or there are micros-aggressions until the past year. 

Unfortunately it’s getting to me, and affecting my mental health and I sometimes gaslight myself thinking is “not a big deal”.

I finally stood up for myself, documented, and spoke to my manager. I found it important to shed light, as my manager “didn’t know” but I also wonder if it’s because people accept behavior that’s not professional from workers who exceed technical expectations and don’t speak up(for whatever reason).

However, my question is what are things you do to not let things that’s are not appropriate for work, such ask condescending and passive aggressive remarks get to you. It really took a toll on me and ruined my whole day. For lack of better words, how can I not give a fuck? I still want to call out the bullshit, but I’m tired of feeling bad and sad at the disrespect.

TLDR: what are your tips to build the confidence to be a badass who doesn’t let anyone get under their skin :)

It’s comforting to see your post, and know that others are struggling with similar situations. Many times I’ve considered quitting my job on the spot just to be done with it. I want to scream at the person(s) for being such dicks. I’ve also doubted myself so many times like am I crazy? Why are they doing this? Why are they doing this to me? Why won’t my boss do anything about it? It’s truly maddening.

I tried not giving a fuck but it just doesn’t work. Another wiser person told me, that every time I see something ridiculous happening, the best thing to do is to be a mirror. Like consider that person’s behavior to be a projection of their internal issues. My role is not to absorb or take in their silliness, but to deflect / reflect their behavior back at them and others. 

This is easier said than done. In practice, I’ve found the following to work to some degree, depending on the situation. For example, if someone is being really rude, I would stay calm and rational in my response, to contrast against their emotional outburst. There’s a person who sends me angry emails daily. I couldn’t challenge them, but I would ignore their rude emails, and only reply when they ask nicely. Other times someone says something really condescending to me, I would repeat it back to make it a reflection. People have also taught me to stare at the other person in the eye, and make the room awkward. I have yet to try that.

There are many ways to go about it. I still make many mistakes and chew on it over and over again at night. I tell myself that I’m learning and getting better. In some ways, it is an essential life skill. I think at the end of the day, most managers won’t do anything about bad behavior. Maybe they find the other person useful in someway, maybe their hands are tied, maybe it’s too much trouble to fire and hire. If the behavior and the person stays, then leaving for greener pastures is inevitable.

However, I'm finding it's not really working out to my advantage. I have quite a bit of domain knowledge and experience with the company. Lately I've been getting stuck in this routine with the senior and lead:

1. VP reaches out to senior or lead asking for help. 
2. Senior/lead forwards the email and I advise/do most of the work
3. Senior/lead returns the deliverable. Sometimes I'm credited but never to the degree that i actually helped.
4. VP congratulates lead/senior for their good work (which was mostly mine) and their work expands, meaning I do more projects with no credit.

There's some other stuff too - like trying to poach management of the intern I currently mentor, but that's the biggest issue. I'm struggling because technically I guess they have some leadership, but it feels like a pretty abusive system.

We have a manager in between us and the VP and I want to raise the issue with her but I'm having a hard time knowing what to say and how strongly. Tbh I'm feeling so frustrated with it I don't fully trust myself to speak to it very well.

Many women naturally tend to use soft language. When that doesn't end up working, they are advised to be more assertive. As soon as they are the absolutely very slightest bit assertive, they are labeled difficult. Many people who do not have a woman's perspective would be shocked how little a woman needs to do to be labeled antagonizing or aggressive.

Arguably, you are putting me in the very same double bind in your post. I didn't say anything about tone or how OP should word their conversation. Much less did I say anything indicating that she should be antagonizing or aggressive. That is because I believe it is always important to be polite and respectful to our fellow humans. Consider what made you think my post was suggesting OP take an aggressive approach and try to reassess it as a woman confidently passing down advice that would have helped her.  

Regarding ""ignorance is more likely than malice"" - I 100% agree. The double bind is a result of [unconscious bias](https://asana.com/resources/unconscious-bias-examples), which is absolutely ignorance and not malice. Nevertheless ignorance is not an excuse. People who point out unconscious bias are often faced with a [semantic stop sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9) such as being told they are making everyone else ""walk on eggshells.""

Antagonism is a crossing of the proverbial Rubicon. If your suspicions are validated and your leadership unsatisfactory in their redress, then switching employers while leaving on good terms is probably the preferable outcome.

1. You could be wrong and it's a lot easier to recover from a soft probe than an aggressive accusation. Perhaps your VP has been telling your CEO that you are being woefully underappreciated and that since he's seeing so much of your work during his own onboarding, this was a great opportunity for him to evaluate how best to help you grow your career. As Rumsfield would say, sometimes one doesn't know what one doesn't know. Or perhaps what you thought was 90% of the value was actually not even 50% and he had to make significant alterations that you didn't appreciate the value of given the disparity in technical experience.
2. Honey is generally more effective than vinegar. Getting his hackles up makes the ""him or me"" scenario more likely. While you might be more experienced with your startup's tech, he's probably more experienced in winning pissing contests by virtue of his age/work experience.
3. Ignorance is usually more likely than malice. Malice does exist and if it was malice then the failure to defend yourself will lead to people walking all over you. If it was ignorance, however, then people will start walking on egg shells around you and then decide it's just easier to avoid working with you, mentoring you, or being associated with you in general.

When you write your email, write it with soft language and positions like Benjamin Franklin would. `I could be wrong but...`, `perhaps I missed his improvements and additions...`, etc. Be firm in your persistence in learning who you're dealing with but be soft in what happened. Let people tell you what they think happened is so they can show you who they are. Is the VP really stealing your spotlight? Maybe he's so overwhelmed with everything on his plate he didn't realize he was over-claiming his contributions. Or maybe he is because he's nervous and wants to make a good impression.

Don't give your coworkers any more opportunities to sabotage you.  Yes, that might mean no more suggestions.  You might do the cool stuff anyway, as long as you don't talk about it beforehand.


Focus on what bullet points you want to add to your resume, make sure your resume is up to date, and once you have been with this employer at least one year, look for another job.


In the mean time, be aware that your incompetent manager's suggestion to stick up for yourself is garbage - it can really backfire spectacularly and could cause negative repercussions.  You know for certain that if things got heated, the manager would *not* have your back.


Think about whom, if any, you would like to be a reference for you when job searching and cultivate those relationships.  Look for professional/career mentorship outside your team if possible. 


When leaving, be sure to do it on a positive note (no matter how false). Don't unburden yourself in an exit interview.  ""It's been a great learning opportunity and I'm grateful for that"".  Repeat until they stop asking for anything further.

I'm worried that this will impact my future negatively, especially as I'm studying on an international work permit and am already stressed about not obtaining a post-grad work permit due to poor grades and an inadequate course load in a previous semester.

If you intend to learn frontend web development, then do that. Python is irrelevant to frontend web development, as it is a backend language, (and backends are written in many different languages so may not even need python if you want to be a backend developer).

When you’re talking about difficulty you’re comparing apples to oranges, as front end is a number of technologies (a stack) and skills that work together for a  particular role, while python is just one language in isolation and has various use cases.

Basics of CSS and HTML are easy to learn. When people then hit JavaScript they often find that hard because it is a programming language and you have to learn programming fundamentals at the same time. This is true of all programming languages.

I’m not sure why you want to spend a whole year self studying before doing the bootcamp - the value of a bootcamp is you learn a lot quickly in a supported environment. I’d suggest self learning for only 3-6months before doing the bootcamp, and then continue to self learn & do practice projects after the bootcamp while you’re looking for a job (which may take 6 months to get. 

There’s a tipping point to learning where you’re not very effective until you have a good base, and for front end dev I found that self learning was a slow ineffective process until after I did a bootcamp.

It's easy to get overwhelmed, but my advice is to start slow and small. I try to steer my co-ops to the simplest tasks we have. Something that might take an experienced dev on our team half a day to complete or so. And I fully expect it to take a co-op a week or more to complete it. And I know they're going to have tons of questions for me too.

Technical jobs tend to have so much context that you have to build up to be efficient. And the full time devs at your company should know that.

If your company assigned you a mentor (and they really should have if they're running a co-op program), you might also express to them that you're feeling overwhelmed and they should be able to help. On the off chance that they didn't assign a mentor, I'd try talking with the most approachable member of your team.

You likely don't even know enough to know what questions to ask to get yourself unlost. That's okay! The key is being humble enough to admit that and to ask for help. Ask whoever you report to if they can explain things in a bit more detail. Get some background. Then ask where you should start. Break it down into really small chunks, the simplest problem you can solve. If you can't figure out what that is for yourself, ask for help.

I don't understand ***anything*** and today one of my coworkers went over my tasks, but I started to feel panic building because I could barely understand what he was *asking* me to do, let alone actually doing it. I tried to ask clarifying questions but it didn't help much, mostly because everything felt so muddled in my brain.

tbh I think I'm extremely under-qualified and this co-op is already looking to be way above my scope of knowledge (which is very little to begin with). It's a very small company in terms of people, so I feel like there's more expectations per person. It's only a 4 month co-op but I'm really panicking and freaking out.

I am extremely stressed and tense everyday after work and can't relax. I'm going to be such a huge disappointment. It doesn't help that the previous co-ops at this company were way better than me. 

And I know many people's first co-op might be a struggle, but I'm..... really clueless. And to be honest... I've never really been naturally tech-savvy. I was basically forced into doing this because my arts degree was useless. I enjoyed some logic courses I took and thought it would be worth a shot. 

I also really hate that I have to participate with deadlines when I don't understand anything. It's just adding to my stress. It's not like I can just ""take it slow and learn at my own pace"" when I have to report what I've done in scrum everyday.

Does he seem interested in seeing you succeed?

Basically - find someone who you think “wow, they’re so smart/cool and I want to be like them” and in return, they seem to really take an interest in your career success/want to take you under their wing… you can find that kind relationship by networking/attending events/going into the office/etc.

You can try talking to your boss, but I’d brush up on your resume and start applying elsewhere first… I just went through this where there was significant unconscious bias at my now previous employer… being singled out “expressgiraffe, do you like golf?” when I’m the only female at the table … my manager interrupting me while I’m leading a meeting he asked me to take over and he does that to only me and not my male counterparts … a man being promoted to be me boss when I was equally qualified, had more tenure, and he had been told he wouldn’t be promoted without relocating (which I had done) … just shitty, shitty stuff that I always kinda thought was all in my head similar to you, but it’s not all in your head … no, you’re not perfect and yes, you have room to improve, but so does your manager and so do your coworkers, so why are you the only one put under the spotlight to be perfect??

I opened up and started talking about the biases I was feeling because my friends all said our company’s HR department was “different” and it completely backfired (because all HR departments are the same - they’re not there for you, they’re there to make sure the company stays afloat and avoids lawsuits) - my VPs response to me bringing up the differences/exclusions/etc. I feel was “I don’t think it’s because you’re a woman” … and then he discussed the things he’s doing D&I wise which included pushing an unqualified woman through to a senior-level interview, and then the call ended with him saying “if you weren’t a woman, you’d be fired by now” … and then two weeks later, I was laid off … 

Sooooooooo - have your ducks in a row to protect yourself before you talk to your boss :) and maybe even have HR in on the conversation as witness or record the call to keep everyone on their best behavior … I didn’t have it recorded, so it’s my word against his, so I had to take my severance and go on my way (urgh.) … but just know that talking to your boss or HR about what’s going on is about 99% likely to end with you being pushed out in some way (demoted, moved into a role you hate, laid off/fired)

So if you like the company besides your boss, then suck it up and find a mentor who can help get you switched to a new team/promoted for “wow, she’s such an awesome employee” rather than “wow, she’s stirring up trouble and called her old boss a sexist” …

I agree with the other post though, that therapy and meditation will help but therapy can be expensive so I get it if you're unable to and sometimes it just takes a really long time to find someone you're comfortable with. I'm not sure if I have any right to offer advice since I'm not working in the industry, so take everything I say with a grain of salt but I'm in my 30s and I have general/social anxiety. I'm very introverted so I'm often lost in my own thoughts and I find that a lot of my self-esteem issues stem from my own inner-dialogue. It's the type of dialogue that leads me into thinking that I'm not wanted on a project because people think I'm incompetent or something of that nature. Regardless of the situation, I try to be compassionate towards myself and others. It allows me to acknowledge my own feelings and sometimes leads to self-awareness of why I feel the way I do in a particular situation.

Something you can look into that might help, and it's helped me, is a self-help book called the four agreements, though I wouldn't recommend buying it, the message is pretty clear and everything else is fluff. I would just google it and look up images for the summary of each agreement and remind yourself of the agreements when you find that you're feeling anxious.

I call it ""ego clashing."" Ego clashing happens when you have multiple engineers trying to resolve a problem and they all believe their own solution is the only one that will work. Time gets wasted as the engineers debate and have meetings to agree on something.

Yes, this is something you have to learn to navigate in order to succeed. It is not always an abusive dynamic, though it can be, in which case the solution is far more simple: Find another job.

To navigate it in a healthy way, stop thinking of it as an argument, because it's not. It is a debate, where you have a stance and you need to defend it. When a team hears each other's reasonings for why they all think they know how to solve a problem, they can either poke holes in the logic or find that they can't. Whoever's solution has the fewest holes in its logic is usually the one everyone agrees on, or a combination approach is coordinated.

During a debate, don't get angry, don't take criticism of your opinions personally, and don't hold grudges afterwards. Speak firmly and directly and be confident in yourself. If others disagree with you and are able to present you with evidence that your way is not the best way, be humble and accept it. If their evidence is not satisfactory, double down and tell them why. They might thank you later.

I would recommend taking 15-30 minutes looking at something you're stuck on, Googling what you can, and if you are really making no progress, that is the time to ask for help. You say you're remote, so I assume you're using something like Slack -- post a message in your team's channel (or another appropriate place) and say ""I'm having problems with X -- I am going to put details in this thread, if anyone has ideas, please let me know"". Then, make a thread (so you don't clutter the channel) and just talk about the specific thing you're stuck on, what you tried, questions you have, etc. This keeps you from spinning your wheels all morning, feeling bad and not making progress, and also gives your team an idea of where you're at and what you have and haven't tried. Sometimes this will even help you figure out the problem! If no one answers right away, just move on to something else for a while and circle back to it in an hour or two.

I will also echo other folks and say that 4 months in after a bootcamp, please don't beat yourself up because you get stuck and you're still fumbling around at times. Pair programming is a great suggestion (especially after you've posted something like what I suggested above), and never feel bad if you have to have a bunch of docs open while you're working or whatever -- whenever I am deep in code my browser bar is a nightmare because of how many tabs I have open. :)

Later, I got into watching Eli the Computer Guy's videos, and started noticing his tendency to go off on long, defensive rants about just about everything, including ""social justice"" etc.

I started googling ""sexism"", ""technology"" and ""reddit"" and came up with some pretty disheartening threads on /r/cscareerquestions where sexism in the industry was scoffed at or denied by male users.

The subject that you like to study in college is only a small part of who you are. You also have personality factors and tasks that you like and tasks that you don’t like. You have interests and enthusiasms and types of weather you prefer. A lot of this stuff is going to take a while to figure out and the people around you who seem like they have it under control...don’t. They may be following expectations of their family or past teachers, for good or ill. They may just be faking it.

So, what should you do? One, be kind to yourself. Two, adopt a philosophy of experimentation. Your job as a young adult should be to try things. You’re gaining experience every day and building up evidence on what makes you satisfied and engaged, as opposed to what makes you cranky, frustrated, bored or withdrawn. Finding out that you don’t like something is also a win. Just don’t give up and try more things.

Based on my own experience and the experience of most women in tech that I've met and read the stories of, bias and career related stress because of it happens to *most* of us. Women being told they are ""too confident"" or ""overly aggressive"" or ""not assertive enough"" is far more common than in men. Sexual harassment and discrimination happen in every industry, but it is definitely prominent in tech. More women leave tech at a faster pace than a lot of other industries. Ignoring this is one strategy (it doesn't remove the fact that bias exists). I did that at the beginning of my career, but it didn't help my mental health pretending that *I* must have somehow done something wrong when many of the people around me were often gaslighting, dismissive, or straight up sexist due to my gender.

I'd argue that recognizing this stuff does exist and being a part of the community for support is a lot healthier for our wellbeing than just pretending there isn't a problem or blaming someone's mindset based on their real experience.

Knowing that I'm not the crazy one and that this stuff exists is how I've been able to navigate a career where there are plenty of toxic environments.

The workforce in general isn't equal in so many different ways that CS isn't the only field with these issues and gender isn't the only thing people use to judge people.  I worked in Emergency Management in the South for years.  I was too young, a Yankee, didn't come from the right background, a woman, and \*Gasp\* didn't go to church on Sunday. 

Did all of that make it hard to get my foot in the door sometimes?  Yup.  Did that stop me from doing my job? Nope.  Being underestimated and not seen as equal showed me a more true side to a lot of people than I probably would have seen. In some cases actually gave me opportunities and helped determine who was a great friend.  And for the people who cared about the actual work and were good at their jobs (aka the ones you want to work with), they couldn't care less if I was a woman or a leprechaun with purple skin.

I guess what I'm trying to say is there's always going to be people who underestimate you or look down on you for something.  Sometimes it's a genuine mistake and it doesn't cost you anything to let it go, they will remember the lesson themselves that much more for not making a fuss.

 For the jerks who don't? People who do that aren't worth listening to. If they can't take the time to get past outdated prejudice, who knows what other opinions they have that are wrong.

Jake was taken under the wing of the CIO to be primed for a sysadmin position. Problem? Jake isn't technology literate, is incapable of researching, and constantly dropping the ball on things.

Reason I ask is that these things can be environmental (pressure from the company or workplace culture), and can also be affected by the pressure we create for ourselves if we don’t walk away from the keyboard or are own worst enemy and don’t use stress management techniques to handle challenges. 

I’m a SWE and at my current company when I started was on a great team that did very well on and theoretically had great wlb (however I put pressure on myself due to my own ambition to skill up as much as I could and pulled extra hours either for work or professional development). Then the team & conditions changed, we were all under stress from stuff we couldn’t control (deadlines, poor decisions, stretched beyond skills & experience, short staffed, poor team culture) and it’s been shitty working here for various reasons. The role hasn’t changed but the team and company culture has.

I also recognise that I have created bad habits for myself which mean I haven’t handled the stress well, and there is no one forcing or expecting me to work long hours.

Your situation is no doubt different, however I don’t think it is the role that is the issue, the problem is more likely be the people/team or company. And this can be helped or hindered somewhat by individual choices/habits/mindset.

You’ve landed in a crappy first position: not the role you want, lack of support, bad manager, outdated tech stack, pressure to deliver, sounds like the whole company is a bit dysfunctional in how it is working.

Know that this isn’t your fault, you’re not incompetent, and anyone would struggle if put in the same situation.

What is it that you want and need, and how do you get it?

1. what role do you want? 

If you’re not interested in a data engineer role, there is no point working hard to get good at your current job as it is a different skillset to other roles. 

If you want to be a software engineer, focus on strengthening web dev skills and applying for entry level roles. However, I would also say that think long and hard about whether you are sure this is what you want. Quite often we say our job is really about solving problems… even when using a modern tech stack there will be some technologies we’ll be using that won’t be well documented, tasks even seniors on the team don’t know how to do, we have to work things out and teach ourselves along the way. You have to be ok with feeling out of your depth and working things out that you weren’t specifically taught.

If you can’t do exactly what you want right now, going back to scrum master might be a position that is less stressful while you work on making the transition.

2. What kind of company/workplace do you want to work? 

I think workplace culture makes or breaks a job, finding a place that will be a good match for you to be able to do your best work. I would recommend writing up a list of what that looks like for you, and researching what companies might be a good fit and/or evaluate potential jobs with this in mind. 

This will make it less likely (no guarantee) to end up in a company and team with a bad manager who has no empathy for your struggles at home and work.

3. What can you do to work towards what you want in 1 & 2? Focus on that, not the crap you’re being handed by your current manager.

Hence using jsdom in your backend (Node) to try and access the DOM.

I might be wrong here, but I there might be a misunderstanding on how you're supposed to manipulate the DOM in the frontend. Jsdom is an emulation of a browser's DOM (often used for testing), not an actual reference to the frontend's DOM. Access to the frontend's real DOM can only be had in client-side JavaScript, not the Node app. So if you want to create a DOM element (say a `<p>`) based on some object you're querying out of the database, you have to first get that data over the frontend-backend barrier. It often goes something like this:

1. In the client-side frontend JS (not the Node app), make a call to the Node app. Usually this is an HTTP request, wherein the Node app listens for requests to certain endpoints. So e.g., a GET to http://my-node-app.com/bunnies/2

2. The node app receives this call and understands it needs to make a DB query to postgres to get bunny with ID #2. Then it takes the result and packages it into the HTTP response, and sends it back to the frontend with status 200.

3. The frontend receives the HTTP response (an object containing details about bunny #2)  and then can call `document.createElement()` and add the relevant fields onto the element, and then insert that element into the real DOM.

But however you phrase it - your brand, your reputation, your areas of expertise or strengths and weaknesses... it's like buttholes, everybody has one whether you like it not.  ""I don't have a brand"" is still a brand.  So why not take ownership of it, just for your own personal benefit?  


I like to work backwards from an annual peer review - what kinds of things would I like my coworkers to say about me?

As far as networking, the best networking happens when you're not trying to selfishly get a job from someone or ""make"" them like you, but just being your normal self.  Take a genuine interest in others - be curious and polite.  If the vibe is off, don't force it.

This is a situation that is smart to prepare for, and to approach it with the understanding that it might mean you have to leave. 

You can lead with a question, such as asking what the options for career growth / promotion are to you with this small firm. 

You can do your research on salaries for your position and cite it, though be prepared for them to scoff / say that's based on ""big companies"" and ""we're a family here, we can't afford that"".

You can can be thankful for being a part of growing company / working with good people / whatever realistically applies, and also say that you have rising costs in your own life or other goals (home ownership, student loans, family to care for / etc) that are problems you need to solve.

Be prepared for them to get emotional (anger IS an emotion) or throw ""disappointed parent"" tactics attempting to guilt you out of wanting to be paid fairly.  Be prepared to be calm and act as an observer of their behavior. You will need to be damp kindling, resisting any fire starting techniques.

Perhaps they will recognize your value, perhaps not. But get your exit strategy plan in order because some will see this as a signal you're willing to leave and recognize they need to work to keep you, whole others will believe the lie that even whispering about wanting more money is ""disloyal"" or ""ungrateful"".

My manager sent me (22F) and my two older male colleagues to it in person this year. I was really looking forward to it since everyone else seemed excited. I wanted to talk tech with new people and get time to network/get to know my coworkers better. 

While the talks themselves have been good, the culture is just not a good fit for me at all. Maybe it’s partially an issue with my company’s culture but the sheer amount of drinking, gambling and sexualizing the waitresses has just made me super uncomfortable. It’s a real shock since I thought I was being treated really well by my corporate culture before. I’ve been working at my current job for two years and I thought people respected me as an equal. :(

Every night after the sessions I say I’m not going to drink but there has been a cocktail reception to meet some of our AWS contacts that I want to get to know. And then when I get to these things (after walking around and feeling unsafe in Las Vegas at night) they never let me say no to a drink. I’m on medication that makes one drink 3 so it has been terrible. I’m just keep ending up sick and lost and scared. I’m lucky nothing worse has happened to me.

Hey, don't sell yourself short - I've had a couple workplaces that separate out ""lead by mastery"" and ""lead by mentorship"" into separate roles. After seeing the results it's kinda obvious that they're genuinely two different skillsets!

but also you reminded me of a story

I've led a few interviews and sat in on a bunch as a team member.  I remember one from like 2015, while I was shadowing a senior engineer who had gotten her start as a telecom sysadmin back in the 90s. The interviewee seemed competent, if over-selling himself a bit. He also had a tendency to rush during the technical portion, interrupting with decent solutions to the first half of the problem. He had to be counter-interrupted and course-corrected to get to the intended questions.

I went to lunch, then came back to a surprise follow-up from the HR person, ""I think we're gonna have to get another batch of candidates but we can't quite decide yet. Since you were just observing I wanted to check in. No notes, no recording, did anything stand out about that interview?""

""You all introduced yourselves and your positions here, right?""

""Yeah...""

""And ${Senior} pretty much exclusively led the interview, right?""

""Yeah...""

""One pattern stood out to me, did you notice how he answered pretty much all of ${senior}'s questions before she finished asking them, and he pretty much always let you and ${manager} finish yours first?""

He said something like ""Oh yeah. huh. I *thought* something felt off about that one..."" and I don't remember the rest of the conversation but I don't think he committed one way or the other.

I have had this in a shared confluence blog, google docs, private repo that only they have access to. I do ask them ahead of time if we can use it so that we can have more focused 1-1s. Most are receptive to it and follow it, some can be blah about it. It's a great way to stay organized and manage up appropriately.

Items on the list: Long term goals, short term goals, wins and shoutouts, and comments/suggestions for him/team/company. 

The long term goal had promotion on the list until I got it. We pretty much spent the time discussing what I can do to get there and how he could help me get there. I can't recommend that enough if you are also gunning for a promotion. This brings up a very natural way to talk about it and remind them.

Wins/shoutouts gave me a place to say nice things about others who helped me but trust that it was mostly a place to beat my own chest. Did I have a manager pull some text verbatim from this section in my annual review? Hell yeah he did. 

And comments/suggestions are ways I can steer the discussion in a certain way, be it something critical about a coworker or if I am lobbying for a tech or process I want. This often overlap with short term goals.

I also take notes and add action items if needed and add it to the shared doc.

This doc is also incredibly useful for when I have to write a self evaluation. And mentioned before how some managers will use it as reference too.

I am currently doing a lot of soul searching. At the moment I am working in a female-dominated humanities-oriented field, which has a lot of pros but also hasn't felt very rigorous or satisfying. Some of my job involves managing data, but I never get to do anything meaningful or fun and it often feels like I'm working in a vacuum.

Lately I have been thinking about doing a coding bootcamp and switching career paths. Back in the day, I was really discouraged because felt like I constantly had a huge chip on my shoulder and was hyperaware that I didn't fit in. I felt like I was either put on a pedestal or actively ignored. I felt like I constantly had to prove myself and often heard comments that made me feel uncomfortable, even if they weren't about me. I found that men were typically either very egotistical and dominated the conversation or passive enablers. (I recognize this is a generalization.) I went to a women in CS club meeting that had more men than women. Hopefully this isn't offensive, but I've also noticed a lot of women in STEM don't really dress up and speak very bluntly. I get along fine with this personality type, but I also don't really belong to this category. I also find that there is just a huge STEM/humanities cultural divide. (I ended up switching to a humanities major.)

I've been reading posts in this sub, but I also understand that a lot of ""girl talk"" is venting about the patriarchy.

My experience has been the opposite. Lots of good women helping other women. Different groups focus on different things (some are for women in tech which includes business types, some are for female coders, some are about moral support and social while others are workshops etc). I value these spaces because reality is women have a different experience and challenges than men, and every other space is designed with men as the baseline and women as the ‘other’.

For example of how alienating non-female groups can be: there’s a woman who runs weekly online events that usually consist of her talking to someone in the industry on a topic, and participants can write questions in chat. Her audience is general - not “for women”, and I would hazard a guess more men than women (because there are more men than women in the industry).

For international women’s day the topic was about challenges women developers have. There was a female guest discussing some of the things she’d experienced. And there were male viewers making comments/questions in chat claiming that now days women get hired “automatically” over men and other such nonsense. And both the female host and speaker responded to these insulting sexist questions in an appeasing way - agreeing that some companies are seeking to hire more women, rather than challenge the sexist insinuation that female hires are undeserving. It made me so mad. 

In female oriented groups there is more awareness and support for women in the industry rather than seeking to please and appease men.  As co-ed spaces have 5–10 ten men for every one woman, I find female orientated spaces an important alternative.

I was a mediocre student then. My best piece of advice is to figure out what motivates you. For me, that was being accountable to other people. After a year or year and half, I had met friends in my major and formed a study group and that was the only reason I graduated.

Most guys (not all!) I met in undergrad and in my career were not short on confidence, even when it was clearly misplaced. Being a poor student made me really insecure for a long time, which I think compounded the confidence gap that a lot of women have.  Anyway, between my poor grades and poor confidence, I think many early opportunities were lost to me.

As far as my experience with sexism in the work place goes, eh, it's very subtle in my field. It's more like, several guys on your team, including your lead, become buddies and go hiking/ to baseball games/ golfing and never really consider inviting the girl because they're all married and inviting a girl would be awkward/ a girl probably isn't interested in said activity/ you just don't click with them as easily. Sometimes it's harder to get a word in during meetings or to get people to listen to you, but I think that has more to do with people's (more likely too be a guy thing) egos than a judgment about you.

Sexism in undergrad was a bit worse. Guys were judgmental of the attractive girls (the girls who were actively trying to be attractive). In hindsight, I think this was because we were all nerds at nerd school, so there was some assumption that girls trying to look attractive were trying to get an undue advantage and/or manipulate others.

1) has happened to me - all candidates were provided with the questions that would be asked on a piece of paper before the interview. 

This was fantastic, it removed some of the usual power imbalance between the interviewer:interviewee as we both knew the questions, being able to read the question not just have to “listen” to the question (some people are more visual than auditory, and when stressed our senses can be weakened), knew how many questions there were, could better plan time in terms of elaborating on the answers we felt more important and being brief on others, and so on. 

I think it is a great technique to do.

Related to that, there are some companies like atlassian that have the approach that their recruiters want to help candidates perform at their best, so they provide as much information as possible about their process. I didn’t go through their whole process & don’t think it extends to providing the questions, but they tell what topics will be covered.

2) some external recruiters are paid only when they place a person, and there are multiple recruiters in competition to place “their” candidate, so some will seek to give unfair advantage to their own candidate.

They may have someone on their payroll who pretends to be a candidate and goes through the process to find out what all the questions are, then they give these questions and suggested answers to all the candidates they represent to try and help them get a job.

What you've described doesn't sound like engineering being wrong for you so much as this team not being the right fit, possibly even toxic. 

It's an enormous red flag if someone said they can't ""baby"" you. That's absurd and incredibly condescending even if you were legitimately doing a poor job which it sounds like you are not based on what they say. 

Can you have a direct conversation with your senior? You could say something like you were so taken aback in the moment you didn't quite respond to the ""babying"" comment in real time, but that after thinking about it you'd like to know what in the world he meant by that. Maybe you can say that you as you adjust to the team's processes of course you need some support... usually for the first 3 months or so even someone pretty senior will need a bit of ""hand holding"" etc.

It's up to you if engineering is the right path but if you're planning to leave this job anyway to go back to an analytics role, it's probably worth talking to as many people about your struggles and options as possible before you do. Make sure you're engaging your manager if I'm understanding correctly that that is a different person from your senior. Some might not take too kindly to a senior person scaring off a promising junior they poached a year ago.... 

Or look at new data engineering roles! Don't underestimate your skillset and frankly, the lack of other workers with it. It sounds like you could be ready for a data eng job at another company.

I will try to give a couple examples. A couple of years ago I was working on an undergraduate group project. Our group was made up of physics and astronomy students and probably had 40% women.  A really overbearing man who had the oroject as his last requirement before graduating (which meant he had submitted his undergraduate project already, and I assume it went well because he was really obnoxious and berating to us about our efforts on the project, despite it being a second year module and in no way meant to be the level of a final year project) tried to get away with putting all the men's names first as authors of the paper. The group was about 15 people, so it's not likely it was an accident.   


Another time, I had technical issues running a program for a different (online) project  on my laptop and there was this guy who insisted it was because I didn't know how to save a file. I explained it wasn't that, but I ended up having to post a video to prove I knew how to save a damn file. I doubt I'd have to have gone through that as a man. Even if it were suggested that it might have been a user issue, I doubt I would have had to go through the lengths I did to prove basic computer competency.  


I am still an undergraduate, and while I've worked with men who've not taken my gender as a handicap, I've encountered just weird reactions and I often feel like I have to do more to be taken seriously.

It didn’t improve things, but it made me feel better to put it in writing. I left a few months later and he was baffled. He apologized and still peeps my LinkedIn profile to this day.

A few thoughts:

Unless there is something I'm missing, the lack of invite doesn't sound intentional--just a mistake.

A lot of people struggle to find close friends.  This has become such a big thing for you, though, that maybe it is better to address it with help?  Could you see a therapist and just say, I want to make good friends?  Then work on it as a project--push yourself to reach out and make contact, set weekly goals for putting yourself out there, develop strategies for figuring out when to network with new people, etc.  

(I am not naturally social.  I have some really good friends now, but when I was in college I had a rule that I had to go to every party I heard about and stay there for 30 min before I could leave.  At first I felt really awkward, but then I got better at talking to people I didn't know.  I would not have learned to do this if I hadn't set a rule.)

If your teachers and counselors are all telling you you'll make friends at the next stage, it doesn't sound like there is an issue that is interfering with your ability to make friends.  (Like, you're insulting people without realizing it, you smell bad, etc.  If this were the case, one of these counselor types would have told you.)  This is good news!

I'm also struck that multiple people are telling you you will make friends at the next stage.  This suggests that either (1) you are so unhappy and lonely that other people notice and want to encourage you, or (2) you are sharing your problems (good for you!) and getting advice.

Final thought:  is there any chance this is the social equivalent of BDD?  You have developed the belief that people don't want to be friends with you, so you don't make the first move and you interpret accidental exclusions as shunning.  If you develop an unhappy, hangdog attitude, that will really dampen your friendship prospects.",1899,testimonial injustice,sorry happen thought unless something miss lack invite sound intentional mistake lot people struggle find close friend become big thing though maybe good address help could see therapist say want make good friend work project push reach make contact set weekly goal put develop strategy figure network new people etc naturally social really good friend college rule go every party heard stay 30 min could leave first felt really awkward get good talk people know would learn set rule teacher counselor tell make friend next stage sound like issue interfere ability make friend like insult people without realize smell bad etc case one counselor type would tell good news also strike multiple people tell make friend next stage suggest either 1 unhappy lonely people notice want encourage 2 sharing problem good get advice final thought chance social equivalent bdd develop belief people want friend make first move interpret accidental exclusion shun develop unhappy hangdog attitude really dampen friendship prospect,"feel, like, manager, engineering, job",0.5816109006125567,"inexperienced, bitterness, belittling, dismissing, ostracism",0.04,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.4951395660297525

>In other PRs, I pointed out why one approach was better other than the one he was using, with clearly stated facts, to which he just replied ""but I prefer to do it this way"".

I think you should make sure you're not ""suggesting"" a better way to do something, but rather asking him to do it the correct way. I.e. your comments on the PR should be ""please implement in this way <link to previous example>""

That is the standard where I work, and it's respectful & effective. Him saying ""but I prefer to do it this way"" is disrespectful IMO

Hard to tell here, but if you have to ask that it sounds like either his work/tickets aren't being scoped out properly, or he's not describing what he's doing in his PR description when he creates it.

Best practices are important too. Where I work, we prefix small suggestions like this with ""nit:"" (nitpick) to emphasize that it's a small correction


Edit: I forgot to mention the most important part, which is basically that this behavior needs to be corrected.

We're responsible to maintaining some parts of the codebase in a shared repository where we don't own the full codebase.

What happens very often when I do code review for one of my team mates is that he either doesn't read my comments, or doesn't understand them, so my questions are often unanswered.

As an example, recently I reviewed a PR where I asked what problem was being solved, and if he had considered what was being done in another part of the code base (with a link to it). It took multiple comments, and a 1-hour call to convince him that his approach was wrong, and in the end he just closed the PR with a comment that stated exactly what I wrote in my original comment.

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong in not understanding something. But if he doesn't ask questions back, I have no way of knowing if he understood something or not, and so can't clarify it.

In other PRs, I pointed out why one approach was better other than the one he was using, with clearly stated facts, to which he just replied ""but I prefer to do it this way"".

Should I refrain from making comments on style and good practices, and only comment when something is being proposed that will break anything? Maybe with fewer comments the important ones would be able to get across better.

When it comes to interacting the team that owns the component we are partly maintaining, the communication has also been lacking. I usually post questions on their team Slack that go unanswered, or find myself needing to get unblocked solely by my own means (which works 100% of the time, at the cost of extra effort thrown into a task). Feels great to be able to do this, but it also feels really alone and disrespectful, as I've gone often beyond my duty to fix some of the issues (even when my team did not own them). For example, I proposed 3 different solutions to enforce formatting source files to the CI build (right now it's not enforced, it just runs on compile, and if someone pushes code to master without running the formatter, then the next person who compiles a fresh master will have formatting changes), but all 3 were rejected and no alternative proposed when I asked about it - in the end I just gave up. Should I change my behaviour to become less proactive in fixing issues?

How can I communicate that this is not ok, and change this?

It’s been a really hard struggle because I feel like I’m turned away quickly since I do not have tech industry experience. I’ve been in the manufacturing industry for about 5 years now and I do believe I have a lot of skills and experiences that would transfer over.

I’ve always been into the tech industry, ever since I was little. I went to school for Mechanical Engineering because I like the design side and that’s what people told me I should do. I really should’ve listen to my instincts, but I was young and didn’t think that it wasn’t the right fit. I have taken jobs that I felt like my degree made me qualified for, not actually what I wanted. Recently, I realized that the main thing that gives me joy at my job, it’s not in my job description and my manager does not see it as a strength. I love analyzing data and coding programs to make my job more efficient. This has ultimately made me ready for the leap into tech. 

Now that I am ready to jump in to tech and do what I’ve always wanted, I’ve had such a hard time making connections and finding an in. I’ve been met with no responses or rejection emails. I know a couple recruiters at one company, and there might be something there, but I don’t want to put all of my eggs in one basket since nothing has worked thus far. 

I have experience with project management on multiple of large scale projects, as well as 20-100 small projects at the same time. I work great in and with cross functional teams.

Post doc messaged our lab group today to suggest buying something for PI for her birthday.  At first, I worried it would make PI uncomfortable. I have tried to buy coffee for PIs before meetings because I was already going to Bux, and been told it was not appropriate because I am a trainee.  I don't know my PI and don't know if she's ok with this. My guess is that she frankly, would not be. And I think that dynamics between postdocs and PIs are different than those between postbaccs and PIs.  Whether they're friendly is none of my business, but there's a huge power differential between a postbacc and a PI.

Additionally, I HATE to be like this, but I make next to nothing. My roommate moved out, and I have to pay rent by myself.  I don't have an extra $20 to buy PI an $80 bouquet right now. I'm coasting off of Ramen packets praying I make it to payday and don't trigger a fatal arrhythmia from sodium overload (kidding, sort of).  I don't have an extra $5 right now.

She's very insistent and I tried to redirect as much as possible, but I'm out of options.  Postdoc and I are not from the same country. There may well be cultural gift-giving differences between where we are from, or even regional differences within the same (very large) country. I don't want to be insensitive to that. I also want postdoc to feel welcome. I certainly don't want an argument. It's just a tough spot to be in right now. None of my family knows how they'll eat.

They approached it compassionately and asked if I had ever felt like I had faced unfairly as a woman. They were being so gentle beating around the bush about how they asked that I almost cut them off to stop the awkwardness and assured them that yes, I had and while sometimes it happens I don't let it get to me. (Partial lie. Truth is I just don't let it get to me while I'm still at work). 

They then asked me how I would respond if I took a call on a question I knew I could answer, but the customer was insisting on talking to a male support engineer. I answered that I would assure the customer that I would be more than happy to answer their question and that I was very confident I could resolve their issue, but if they would rather wait for one of my coworkers I would be happy to take a message and someone would call them back when they become available, but that I could not make any guarantees on how long that might take. 

They seemed very happy with that answer, and followed it up by assuring me that they do not tolerate abusive customers and that if it can down to it they would be more than willing to fire a customer in support of a support engineer who was just doing their job. 

This was a very refreshing interaction and made me feel very much at ease with the idea of joining this particular team.

I’ve spoken about things that were unfair that I couldn’t do anything about, and how it impacted me and the choices I had to make. 

For example, being in interviews that were going well until they asked about the gap in my resume and, when I said I had a child, suddenly all body language changing, tone became chilly, interviewer talking about how hard they work… clear prejudice against mothers. This led me to working for myself as a contractor for a period of time as the industry I was in at that time clearly had prejudices against hiring mothers as employees however these types of questions didn’t come up for contract work. I’ve also spoken of working at dysfunctional workplaces, including sociopathic behaviour, and how this has led me to prioritise workplace culture above all else. I wasn’t able to solve the issues in these situations, however it prompted different life paths.

However I’d only be able to talk about this well if the interviewer had put me at ease, good psychological safety. 

This question in an interview is potentially loaded, might be a red flag in itself. 

If asked with compassion, it might be a person seeking to understand what obstacles a person may have had to overcome that could explain an unconventional resume…

However, if asked as a normal question it is an odd choice (potentially triggering for the interviewee) and if I didn’t feel comfortable to answer it, I might turn the tables and put it back to them… that I don’t think that is a fair question to ask an interviewee as it is potentially triggering, and the dynamics of an interview there is an imbalance of power and they need to be mindful not to abuse that power. I’m the kind of person to call it as I see it. So I’m calling them out on that. Redirect the question.

But that is me. I’m not saying it’s a successful interview strategy.

My personal take on interviews is that it’s a bit like a date: you’re not trying to please everyone, you just want to find a good match. If you pretend to be something you’re not and they like that, then you have to keep pretending to be that (not good); if you show your true self and they don’t like it, best to find that out early; if you show your true self and they like it - that’s a good match.",2318,testimonial injustice,always honest spoken thing unfair anything impacted choice make example interview go well ask gap resume say child suddenly body language change tone become chilly interviewer talk hard work clear prejudice mother lead work contractor period time industry time clearly prejudice hire mother employee however type question come contract work also speak work dysfunctional workplace include sociopathic behaviour lead prioritise workplace culture else able solve issue situation however prompt different life path however able talk well interviewer put ease good psychological safety question interview potentially load might red flag ask compassion might person seek understand obstacle person may overcome could explain unconventional resume however ask normal question odd choice potentially trigger interviewee feel comfortable answer might turn table put back think fair question ask interviewee potentially trigger dynamic interview imbalance power need mindful abuse power kind person call see call redirect question say successful interview strategy personal take interview bite like date try please everyone want find good match pretend something like keep pretend good show true self like best find early show true self like good match,"woman, job, tech, developer, software",0.7385625181886205,"abuse, rejection, misuse, assessed, abusive",0.5199999999999998,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.4553871561732736

I'm in the UK and my background is that I have a degree in modern foreign languages and a PGCE, but had burn out and problems with my health so I was signed off work several years ago. I have PTSD, OCD, migraines and possible ADHD (waiting to be assessed). 

I've been working on my stability to get back into work. As part of my recovery I started painting, then went to art college and learnt textile design. I'm currently to try doing this as my job on a self employed basis. So far it has been difficult to do and earn a living from but I love it so I was going to give it another year before reviewing. I'm 39, single, no kids and concerned about my future in terms of supporting myself financially. 

I guess I was thinking in terms of a backup plan, I could learn graphic design or coding if textile design doesn't work. I was thinking I could do a short online course this year to try coding out. When I was at uni I did some modules in IT and learnt some html and created a website which I really enjoyed, but it was 20 years ago so things have moved on a lot since then.

My questions are, is it difficult to break into this type of work? Is it very challenging for people with health conditions? Do you always have to work full time and long hours? I can no longer work long hours after burn out so would need to work 4 days max, most likely remotely, either freelance or with a company that let me work from home.

The reason was in short that we both work in an Environmental Studies Department on marine topics. While her approach is social science, I did an interdisciplinary study fusing ecology with some social science. Somehow this didn't sit well with her and apparently I offended her pride. Since then she has been the most passive-aggressive and revengeful person I have ever met:

- she withholds important information from me, e.g. deadline dates
- she outright lies to me on email about regulations, important information regarding my defense, telling me she is sick and can't reply to me for weeks when this is actually not true (I kept all these emails as proof)
- she slandered my reputation at the department, oversharing personal information and false information (other PhDs have told me what she said)
- she simply doesn't reply to me 
- she has refused to see me in person for almost 2 years, arguing that as I finished my field research, she is not required to do that anymore
- she takes credit for my achievements and blames all mistakes solely on me
- she has stalled my thesis review for 1 semester and now delayed my thesis defense for another semester. This is when I contacted the dean of our department for the second time to ask for help.

The dean and chair seem on my side and set up a mediation for next week. But I am still so scared how things are going to go. Because I know how she is. During the mediation she will either blame it all on me or just smile and say how sorry she is, that this is all a big misunderstanding, that the lies were miscommunications etc. Then everyone will tell me, see, things will be fine now! And she will just continue to abuse her position of power.

I am super scared as this woman will grade my Phd and in the end has the power to decide over me getting it or not.

What shall I do? Do you have any advice?

People with abusive personalities do this -all.the.time.- and corporate managers, lawyers, police offers and court officials react in this manner to it -all.the-time.-. (sigh). I feel your anxiety. I know what this is like -- knowing an abusive person has power over you, can change the outcome of your future. I try to tell myself that it is temporary and any set backs they cause me will just make me find away around it - creatively and it will be a skill I will have learned for the better. 

I do not have any experience for getting a PhD. I feel in adequate in my reply because of it -- but I do know intimately the personality you're dealing with and the anxiety that comes because of it. 

My only logical questions (you do NOT have to answer these) would be: 

1. Is there a department (like an ethics department) you can make 'anonymous' complaints to about this behavior?

2. Is there anything in your contract that would prevent you from reporting this mess anywhere (like the licensing board of HER type of PhD)?

3. Is reporting it going to make things worse for you? If so, how long do you have to ""bide your time"" before you can get out of there? What are some options you can do afterward to salvage the experience you gained if it goes south?

These questions may not help. I recognize that. When you've been dealing with this type of thing this long, I bet you've already asked yourself these questions and the answers feel quite limiting.

* For her to be ""punished"", 
* to have your experiences validated
* a graduation plan?

Disclaimer: make sure this advice is culturally appropriate before using!

Once you know what you want, you can build an agenda. Email it to everyone if appropriate.

Personally if I were you, I'd want to come out with a list of graduation action items, due dates, who is responsible, alternative resources you can access and what the escalation pathway is if the items aren't done. One action item can be a status report which you submit fortnightly / monthly / whatever to the dean / chair so your progress is visible. If hierarchy is important this could ""shame"" her into doing her job.

I'm thinking if you go in there with a concrete plan, the conversation can't get derailed by her blaming you.

If culturally appropriate consider the following:

* learning a bunch of stock phrases to prevent her from derailing the topic which acknowledge she has spoken but do not engage. For example ""I see your point, however right now I need to know [re-state your action item]"", ""OK"", ""Hmm I think we should talk about that at the end, what date should action item X be done""

* Limiting the choice you give people when asking for something, e.g. ""I think the escalation pathway should be to the chair then the dean"" look chair in the eye and say ""does that work for you""?

* practice saying ""that doesn't work for me"". e.g. if she suggests no escalation pathway say ""sorry that doesn't work for me"". Then silence. Let it get awkward if need be.

* If your advisor is withholding key information, have them as questions ""how do i find out about X?"" if she says ""I'll tell you"" ask ""who else has this information"". If she asks why, repeat your question ""I'd like to know who else has this information"".

If you have to engage, have your proof ready. But if you get into a ""you're wrong"" argument will it change anything? I'd save the crushing until after graduation (e.g if she broke regulations report it to whomever you can anonymously once your out etc.). If she says you suck or whatever I'd personally say ""well that may be the case, however what date should X be done by [or other action item]"".

I think promotion bias and poor leadership is just common in tech. Everyone assumes for example that a good developer will make a good manager. That's simply not true. Management is a different job, and I don't feel like companies provide enough training or support for new managers. They're just dumped in for a trial by fire. Developers specifically seem to last a few months or a year and turn around and leave for a developer job somewhere else when they realize they dislike management and the meetings that come with it. That promotion bias also seems super common across the board, unless you're outperforming your peers in a big way or really extroverted and charismatic then leadership isn't going to know a single thing about you beyond whatever your direct leader says in reviews. 

My bank experience was a joke. Rampant and blatant sexism, racism, and other types of discrimination. This included work assignments that presented any opportunity landing on white male team members regardless of skill levels or experience. Some of them were wildly unqualified while female or minority team members had experience and the skills to complete those assignments. This included frequent, blatantly offensive conversations in meetings and break areas. This included HR sweeping reports under the rug because ""it's our *culture* to make sure our employees feel comfortable expressing their opinions."" It also included shutting down potential improvements from female or minority team members because ""This is how we've always done it.""

I used to work at a more tech oriented company but made the switch over for what I thought was better job security and wlb.

Turns out I was so wrong. I admit some banks have definitely been better than others. But I’m really struggling at the one I am in now

1) First, the sucking up to management to get promotions (which I also acknowledge isn’t bank specific but an issue I’ve heard about a lot). We have a “rockstar” performer on our team who regularly works from 6AM to 9PM. This rockstar is obviously a favorite of my manager and gets to talk to all of the VP’s because the only way to really secure a promotion is if the VP’s and MD’s acknowledge you. And although this rockstar always talks about how he loves working with others/knowledge sharing, it’s obvious he doesn’t like competition because once I suggested working with him on a visibility project - I didn’t even care about the visibility, I literally thought it was a cool project - and he was really cold towards me and never got back to me about it. To his credit, he is very knowledgeable about things though. 

2) Incompetent managers. My current manager has to be the most incompetent one I’ve ever had. My first month, he ignored almost every message I sent him, even though he would follow up my questions with his own unrelated questions. He also continuously misses out 1 on 1’s. And he has this habit of not understanding what I’m talking about and then getting annoyed. I don’t have an accent, but I do understand that sometimes I don’t explain things clearly, but I’ve never had this issue in the past. He also expects that because I came from another bank that I know every single financial term this bank uses. Worst is when he doesn’t understand something I say, the rockstar translates it for me into something he understands.

3) WLB. It’s sucked at every bank I’ve worked at . 

I think the old me would have wanted to bring some of these issues up with him, but I feel like there’s no point given how political the climate of this bank is and how my manager clearly doesn’t want to lead others.

I did notice that you said “the code works but I’m told to change more things. My project worked ages ago but he is creating a lot of overhead for me”. I’ve heard similar frustrations often from juniors I’ve supervised and getting past this will be helpful in your growth as an engineer because there’s almost always more than one way to code something. The solution you came up with may not be efficient or as extensible as it needs to be. The overhead, which I imagine might be writing tests or documentation, could be helpful to future you, trying to make a change to the code in 6 months down the road, if you’re offered a full-time role. If your co-worker’s not explaining why he’s asking for changes or creating overhead, I’d continue to ask him why. Get him to explain things to you with the framing that you’d like to learn more to improve your next implementation. I like to tell my juniors that if you are learning something in the process, even if your code is thrown away or you end up taking down production, it was *not* useless. 

It does sound like you’re extremely anxious about how your performance is viewed and I’d recommend if you haven’t, just ask about it. You can ask this co-worker if they have any feedback for you or ask your manager for clearer expectations of how an intern should be performing. I think you might be pleasantly surprised by their responses and they can help you level set your expectations for yourself.

If you think this is fun, wait until you discover that not only will they question everything you say and do, they won't support you at promotion time.  They'll promote their guy friends over you.  Eventually when they've taken care of their pals they'll throw you a crumb.  Oh, and they'll come up with a million useless excuses, essentially blaming you. It's not that hard to make a mountain out of a molehill if it's necessary to get their way.  They'll also tell each other about all the cool new opportunities and essentially shut you out.  You won't find out until too late, which will of course slow your career development.

For me, the way around it was to change jobs/companies every 4-5 years.  The time I spent 9 years at one place was 4 years too many, and I missed out. I got terrific reviews but magically ALL of my coworkers, ALL of whom were male, were promoted ahead of me.  Apparently hard work and great reviews weren't enough.  I wasn't in the 'club', so I didn't catch a fair shake.

If you can keep your skills current you'll find you'll be treated most fairly (if that's even possible) when you're negotiating for a new job.  Don't believe them when they lowball and say you'll get promotions and raises later.  It's a crap shoot.  Quite often it won't work out.  GTFO when you see that they're not treating you fairly, e.g. the guys are consistently getting promoted over not just you, but the other women as well.

I've found that the work is the easiest part.  Just being treated fairly was always the hardest part.  Not all guys are this way, but enough of them are that the 'good' ones really don't make much of a difference.

I know I sound bitter but I'm not the only one I've seen treated this way.  I watched a female PhD who was absolutely brilliant catch the runaround and get treated like shit for years and years.  After she made Principal Engineer (finally; she'd earned that 5 years earlier) she decided that she didn't want to stay there and moved on.  She was utterly demoralized by the way she was treated, and she was easily as competent or more so than her peers.  When I see shit like this I think, ""Well, if they're screwing with her, what chance do I have?"" so I left too.

My consolation:  Instead of spending my lower salary, I saved and saved.  I maxed out 401k every year.  I put money into the stock portfolio.  As a result, I'm pretty close to being able to fund my retirement, and I'm way ahead of schedule with respect to retirement. When the next shitstorm arrives, they'll be scrambling paycheck to paycheck to maintain their expensive houses, spendthrift family, car loans, etc. and I'll be trying to decide what restaurant I want to eat at any given night. The cat will stay spoiled, and maybe I'll get a part time job to keep from being bored, or do some open source work, but I won't be forced to do anything if I don't want to.

I feel really badly about having to quit without having something else lined up, but I just didn’t have anything left to give.

Since leaving my job I’ve felt a lot of relief, but also bitterness that it had to come to this, and fear that I might not be able to get my career back on track. I’m not very confident that I can find an employer who really meets my needs now. 

Before the pandemic, I had no issues with being the only woman on my engineering team, because my colleagues were so nice and supportive. However, after a year of essentially working two jobs simultaneously and failing miserably at both while my male colleagues were free to focus on their careers because their wives were bearing the brunt of the school closures for them, I felt very differently. That experience was so painfully demoralizing and isolating and felt so unfair that I don’t know if I will ever really be able to move past it, and I guess I’ll always be afraid it might somehow happen again.

Going forward, I want to find a company that’s good enough at attracting and retaining women (including mothers) on its technical teams that I won’t be the only one, but I know these are in the minority. Also, though I’ve been using my time off to recharge and carefully brush up on my skills, the 18+ months where I was struggling to keep it together really destroyed my confidence and ability to handle extra stress. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation and been able to move past it (emotionally or career-wise)? How do I find good employers with relatively low stress work environments and more balanced team demographics? How do I keep my negative feelings about being the “only” on the team from derailing my career?",2053,testimonial injustice,year juggle full time software engineering kid remote learn plus general pandemic stress finally end severely burned break october year put notice despite thing objectively good kid back person school feel really badly quit without something else line anything leave give since leave job felt lot relief also bitterness come fear might able get career back track confident find employer really meet needs pandemic issue woman engineering team colleague nice supportive however year essentially work two job simultaneously fail miserably male colleague free focus career wive bear brunt school closure felt differently experience painfully demoralize isolate felt unfair know ever really able move past guess always afraid might somehow happen go forward want find company good enough attract retain woman include mother technical team one know minority also though use time recharge carefully brush skill 18 month struggle keep together really destroyed confidence ability handle extra stress anyone else similar situation able move past emotionally career wise find good employer relatively low stress work environment balance team demographic keep negative feeling team derail career,"help, make, new, project, colleague",0.7219697403241667,"inexperienced, bitterness, belittling, dismissing, ostracism",0.5199999999999988,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.5018575114859909

This is such a breath of fresh air and exactly the sanity check I needed, because while I know this woman is full of shit, there is of course a nagging part of me that does wonder...

I'm a normal human being with normal human limitations, and a shitton of very expensive knowledge and experience.

And the last thing I need is middle management negging me into doubting myself and my abilities when I just casually fucking mention that the goals we have seem high.

I've gotten more used to padding my hours and I've never gotten flak about taking too long for a task, which is good and frankly a miracle to me. Thank you so much for confirming that that is what I should be doing. A big part of me just freaking hates lying on a timecard every week. I do get the sense from leadership and my manager especially that padding hours is the goal, but then the dissonance between that and all of the various talks we get about how we ""need to be more efficient"" and how we need to pay attention to ""what is and isn't billable"" and how we need to ""do our best to increase profitability for the company"" (when they don't even give annual raises over 2.5%?? stfu) is just madness inducing. I don't know if this is just what they think ""leadership"" is or what.

To be honest, what this reads to me as, this woman wants people to pad their hours. She doesn’t care about output, only what is billable - and if people pad their hours that is more billable hours. 

She also sucks as a manager as she doesn’t care about the well-being of those she’s managing (not just burn out, but not caring about the impact of being disconnected), and it doesn’t sound like the most effective way to work - not practicing agile or any methodology.

My recommendation?
- start padding your hours, but actually spend less time working than you currently do. Before you get to the point of feeling ineffective, take a break, reclaim some more time for yourself and your well-being. Believe it or not, this may not affect your work output at all - as you have noticed, these extra hours aren’t productive time. 

-  perhaps find a women in tech type online meetup that you can join for some networking and “face to face” so you don’t feel so isolated.

- with that extra time, when you are ready, start looking for a new job.

I know you feel that all jobs have a certain amount of bullshit, however I think that cynicism is because of the experiences you’ve had to date, and are not a signifier of what you could have in future.

I am a  career changer and all the places I worked in my past career were pretty dysfunctional, toxic, bad work life balance - when I decided to change careers I did a lot of self reflection to identify what would be important in my next employer. I prioritised work place culture, looking at the values a company has, how they talk about their employees, what policies they have, etc. Where I work is pretty damn good, no expectation to overwork, unlimited wellbeing days, my tech lead takes a coaching approach to management, very supportive environment.

So I’d recommend doing some reflection on what your wish list is, what red flags to avoid, and go looking for a company that will meet more of your needs.

Generally speaking, a company that does billable hours will suck. The entire mentality is more production line.

I just need to get it out I guess. I don’t love working, very few people do, but I like my job enough. It’s challenging without being overwhelming, the things we build are relatively meaningful, I’m fully remote and have a lot of flexibility with how I structure my day, and for the most part I’m treated like a human, except for when I end up speaking with my boss’s boss about pretty much anything related to actual work during our one on ones, which are thankfully only monthly.

She brought up that she’d be pulling me out of a weekly meeting for a project that I am on but only do a little bit of work for, which is fine but I expressed that I’ll miss being in the meeting because we’re all remote and geographically distant and it’s nice to hear from people and feel like I’m on an actual team versus just working alone in a room all day (we don’t do stand ups or anything and my position is not client facing at all, so my time spent talking to people is otherwise pretty limited.) I have one other weekly project meeting I’ll still be on but having two was nice. For context these meetings are roughly an hour long, usually shorter.

And then I fucked up by also saying that it was nice to have an “easy billable hour” and oh boy did that send her. She let me go on a bit about how the work I do is mentally taxing and having that hour back won’t really make a difference in what I get done in a given week because there is just a finite limit to what I can reasonably, meaningfully produce before I start making mistakes/outputting garbage and then she went on this spiel about how “we don’t have the budget on the project for that” (this is honestly laughable considering the tiny percentage of the project budget one hour a week comprises, but sure that’s fine) and “the meeting isn’t always billable to the client if you don’t have that many items“ and “your annual billable hours goal isn’t unreasonable, you only need to bill 32 hours a week” which is actually untrue, when you factor in days off and PTO I need to reach 35 billable hours a week, which is honestly insane considering most meetings are not billable, training/getting up to speed on components/projects or training other people on components/projects is not supposed to be billed (and even the most experienced people at the company need to do this because our product has so many moving parts, it’s common to forget entirely how some of them work if you don’t look at them for a while), and we have ongoing training both company wide and developer specific that we are supposed to complete, plus about a billion company wide emails and initiatives to deal with and sort through almost daily.

All pertinent information which I stupidly pushed back with, only for her to deliver the cherry on top, “other people don’t have any issues reaching these goals,” “it’s just the company expectation,” and “you know, baconbrand, you consistently log 40 hours a week, a lot of people work 43-45 hours. It’s totally fine that you do that as long as we can all be honest and understanding that it’s going to hinder your advancement at the company.” Cool cool cool, good to know that everything is fine and reasonable and I’m just actually an idiot who isn’t even cut out for this job. (For the record there are only two other devs under her, one is my boss who has a lower billable hours goal as a manager, and is just more comfortable than me about padding his hours, and the other is the same title as me and he also has trouble reaching his billable goal every year, but let’s just ignore that to tell me I’m the idiot outlier I guess. The other people under her are not developers and attend way more meetings.)

So great to hear that being more efficient and effective my job isn’t what’s going to get me level changes, no, it’s those magical extra 3 to 5 hours a week?? UNPAID extra hours, as we are all salary???

Also, level changes and promotions do not come with a raise at my job. So I don’t understand why I’m supposed to care about them at all. I don’t want more responsibility for the same pay.

Anyway it’s just frustrating and for some reason worse coming from another woman. Like this person who’s been management for 20+ years literally still sees people as actual robots where hours in = productivity out. She doesn’t see what I see, which are the loads and loads of tech debt from this mindset that make it take way longer than it should to get stuff done. She doesn’t care if I’m tired and inefficient. She doesn’t want to see and so she doesn’t see all the rework our team ends up doing during “crunch” periods that have no reason to be crunchy at all, but are because she’s a bad manager who thinks that crunching is normal and even noble. She knows for a fact that if I burn out, it’s a reflection on me as an individual who just couldn’t cut it (in the most boring, uncompetitive corner of CRUD development in the world; this isn’t startup or FAANG level shit here) and not an issue with management or the company.

So yeah idk. I’d look for a new job but at this point in my career I know that every job comes with a certain flavor of unfathomably deep bullshit and it’s just a matter of deciding what bullshit I can stomach. If anyone has any advice on how to compartmentalize this stuff so that I can actually get work done verses stewing in how stupid everything is, that would be great.

Over the past two weeks, I have met with the VP and director above my manager, as well as my former supervisors. All of them have expressed extreme concern about how my manager handled this, and have had nothing but incredibly positive things to say about my performance and how I am viewed by senior leadership. The executive said that she was in the meeting and doesn't remember anyone making a derogatory comment like that about me or any engineer. She said that if she had heard someone say something like that, she would absolutely correct them immediately but that she didn't recall anything like that being said about me.

Today, I learned that this manager said the SAME thing to another engineer on a different team. I think maybe this was a tactic. Maybe he was being lazy, or trying to manipulate me into trusting him and nobody else. He framed it as an us vs them, I have your back situation. I don't think he expected me to respond the way I did. Most people would internalize this and feel like crap, maybe work a little harder, and maybe feel like their manager is the only one who sees any potential in them. A lot of people would be so anxious and embarrassed they would not bring it up to senior leadership.

I'm far enough into my career and have enough accomplishments and demonstrated skills that after I got done being angry and hurt, I realized this was completely unfounded and I was ready to go scorched earth. I demanded he report it to hr. He hedged. Perhaps he knew it hadn't really happened and didn't expect me to demand that so he tried to delay things and pacify me. He grossly miscalculated.

I went to the top, and his leaders were horrified that he made one of their most promising, rising engineers doubt her future in the organization.

My mental health is in the toilet because of my current job in bi analytics/consulting. Lately, my responsibilities are mounting higher than ever, and I feel I have little support, and actually feel I am being treated with animosity from some coworkers (not surprising for women in tech). From when I started working here, I have feared what my work/life balance would become like once I reached a certain level because I saw what my managers went through. 

The working environment itself is imo very unhealthy. Requirements are constantly changing, fires need to be put out daily, usually more than one, and I am in survival mode most of the time and it is not sustainable. I have had many moments where I've nearly walked out. I feel incompetent because I am always under scrutiny and like I can't actually work on improving my technical skills because I'm always chasing the next problem.

I would like advice/someone to share their experiences,wyyp04,,"I've realized while I've been applying to jobs recently that I enjoy the management aspect of being on an engineering team more than the actual engineering. It took me a while to see myself as a manager because I grew up in a very misogynistic environment where women weren't allowed to be leaders.

My last engineering position was a senior position where I led a team for about 2 years. In addition, I've basically led every team I've been on, I just didn't realize that's what I was doing because I had such a negative association with being a woman and being a leader (I didn't want to be seen as bossy and controlling, but I wanted to help teams collaborate and work together to accomplish the goals.) I led a lot of major projects in the organizations I've been in and helped redefine org initiatives and standards. I also helped interview, hire, and mentor new team members.

That being said, none of it was official in my job titles and I was definitely underpaid and looked down on the whole time I was doing it. I had to fight through a lot of discrimination and convince the teams that my ideas would work and that I had a good understanding of the concepts they were dealing with before they were open to discussing solutions and ideas.

The companies I worked with were affiliated with a religion that is very misogynistic, so I don't think the misogyny is as bad elsewhere, but I still feel like it would be more difficult for me to jump into a management position at this point due to my gender.   I feel like it might be harder to convince the software engineers I'm over that I know what I'm doing and can help find solutions.

That's why I'm wondering, do you think it's best for me to start working for a company as an engineer first and then move into a management role, or do you think I should apply to management roles first?

I am currently doing a project for AP Research about genetic engineering in humans and I am supposed to ""interview"" people from a variety of backgrounds (no qualifications necessary) to hear their thoughts on this ethically charged issue. I was wondering if anyone would be willing to type their responses and share their opinions. If you feel like sharing, could you please give provide a brief description of yourself (age, education, gender, occupation, race, etc). Thank you!

1. We could improve the human race through genetic engineering by eliminating certain undesirable traits and diseases. Do you believe scientists should explore this possibility at the risk of putting innocent lives in danger through experimental trials?
2. In 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui created the first genetically modified human baby. By editing the CCR5 gene, Jiankui’s goal was to create a child immune to AIDS. What is your reaction to this- is it ethical for scientists alter an embryo’s genomes before they are born?
3. A new technology named CRISPR can be used to edit DNA sequences in people after they are born to correct genetic errors that cause disease. Do you believe it is ethical to alter the human genome in order to save the lives of adults and children?
4. Currently, there are a lack of international restrictions on genetic engineering in humans. Do you believe this should be decided with each individual nation or should there be global restrictions in place?
5. Opponents of genetic engineering argue that scientists should not have the power to “Play God”, do you fear that advancements in this field could make society less accepting to people who are different?
6. Likewise, if genetic engineering becomes advanced enough, should people be allowed to use this power to alter basic human traits such as height, intelligence, or athletic ability?

1. Yes, as long as the standard rules of ethical experimentation are observed. It's no different from developing a new drug or procedure.
2. Yes, if the baby is already at risk, it makes sense to try to fix the problem before birth. However, it sounds like He did it in an unethical and dishonest way.
3. Yes. There's an element of risk, but that's science for you.
4. I think researchers should be restricted by the laws of the parents' country of origin, to avoid people experimenting in international waters. The medical systems of different countries are different.
5. I don't believe in God, but humans began ""playing God"" thousands of years ago when we started planting crops. I'm not too worried about a GATTACA situation honestly. People will always find some reason to hate those who are different. The focus of the discrimination changes, but people don't change. I don't think we can justify telling people they can't spare their kids a lifetime of pain just because some other kid might get made fun of. If we can save lives, we need to push forward.
6. These kinds of modifications are not quite as defensible. I don't think it needs to be illegal, but I wouldn't do it. I think in the future it will be considered a little gauche to do that to your kids. For instance, plastic surgery is widely available today, but that doesn't mean everybody gets it.
7. It would have to be up to the parents, as advised by the doctor. Sort of like circumcision. This gets a little thorny when you consider traits like autism and Deafness, where you have adult members of a community proclaiming that there's nothing wrong with them. I think it will become one of those things that is considered rude to ask new parents about.
8. A lot of people are worried about a world full of tall blonde Aryan clones, but I think common sense will prevail there. I'm more worried about all the mistakes that scientists are going to make along the way. We've already had issues with genetically modified crops that ended up being bad for the soil.

I was given the spot he had requested and so we both assumed there had been a mistake in the paperwork and I went to talk to the team lead to get it corrected.  When I told her what happened she said, ""there was no mistake, we gave the spot to him.""  After I pressed for an explanation, she said that since both of us were underclassmen that she didn't know very well all she had to go on was our grades...I knew for a fact I had higher grades than my friend in most if not all our classes and my gpa was much higher than his was (We were friends. He'd told me that and frequently asked to study together to improve his grades.)  I didn't want to say anything that my friend told me in confidence, so I just stared at the team lead until she sighed.  ""Look, it's just a fact men are better engineers than girls and we can't have someone in this slot that doesn't know what they're doing.""

I saw red.  What just came out of this woman's mouth?  I kept my cool and said I wanted to talk to the professor because I wanted to appeal for reconsideration for the slot.  I reiterated that I knew that the guy didn't want the slot and he wanted mine and left the grades talk out of it.  

The professor said we should have a challenge and whoever does better on the challenge would get the slot.  My friend said he wouldn't participate the challenge and I got the position.  The rest of that year the upperclassmen would make shitty remarks about how I stole my friend's opportunity.

In the workplace I've been questioned and harassed about my abilities but NOTHING has been as demoralizing as what happened that year.  This story makes me less angry than it used to, but that's because I now do that same type of work for a living now and I know that I'm very good at it.

I started college ten years ago as a first-gen student and have had to combat homelessness, abuse, multiple sexual assaults, poverty and disabilities, among other things. I barely went to high school. My parents struggled with addiction, and didn't believe it was important-so I didn't go. I never thought I could graduate high school, let alone college. It's been SUCH a bumpy ride and at times, I thought I literally wouldn't survive it. Many times, I didn't want to.

During undergrad, I met the best mentor I've ever had. She says she believes every student deserves a chance, and I really think she means it. I've known her for five years, and in all that time, she never gave up on me. Even after I was no longer her student or in her lab, she continued to advise me. She has taught me a lot about proper research conduct, and also about appropriate relationships and conduct in research. I posted about what I went through at Yale a while back. Had it not been for this PI at my undergrad university, I never would have been able to identify that what was happening to me was a problem. I spent my childhood being physically and emotionally abused by the people who were supposed to take care of me, so I didn't know what normal was. She's taken the time to show me.

She even takes traits about me that other people don't like, and turns them into positives. I could go on, and on about the things she's given me, but, I digress.

ANYWAY, I have been trying to get back to her for years, but she never has any funding. One of her students left, and I was able to apply to the PhD program. I somehow managed an interview. I think because I had a number of faculty members advocating for me...but I'm happy to get the opportunity, however it arose.

I'm nearly 30 and I thought this would never happen for me. I don't think I'll get in-they're interviewing almost 40 people and have less than ten spots-but this is farther than I ever thought I'd get. I never thought I'd even get to apply to a PhD program.

In June of 2021, I decided that I wanted to leave my toxic job with sexist, mean coworkers. I applied to a FAANG on a whim, it was the only “large” company I applied to. Didn’t hear back and got hired at a company where my coworkers & teammates are endlessly kind and helpful. The first of October, I hear from the FAANG inviting me to interview. I pass the initial phone screen and move on to my technical round. I have ADHD, and DSA for whatever reason is incredibly difficult for me. So I started studying, every single day, for anywhere between 3-12 hours depending on how much time I had after work and on the weekends. 

I completed around 80 LCs, mostly east/mediums and spent the most time on DP and Graphs since that’s what this company is known to ask about. I felt confident that even if I couldn’t get the most optimal solution, I’d be able to solve it. 

Well, not only did I not solve it. I didn’t even *start* it. It was a question that was admittedly very easy but my mind completely went blank. I didn’t even know where to start and after about 20 minutes of getting clarification I decided that I wouldn’t solve it at all. And I asked the interviewer if we could just use this as a learning opportunity and go through the solution together. As soon as I asked my voice broke and I realized I was crying and my interviewer started to console me. It was embarrassing. I wasn’t crying because I couldn’t solve it per-say, but because I *know* I could solve it and even after all my preparation my ADHD still won. 

In the end, it’s not a huge deal. I love my current job and my coworkers, I get paid well. I work from home. Like, I wasn’t even looking to leave my current job. But I just feel really disappointed in myself and even more disappointed that I *cried*. I *NEVER* cry but I broke down in front of this stranger and embarrassed myself. I just wish I could have done better that’s all.

I'm speculating here, but ideally you'd have a manager who gives you continuous and useful feedback. Especially if you're only 1 year into your career. Now to be fair, I feel like almost every new grad I know goes through a similar struggle where they don't know how well they're doing.

When I got my first software job out of college, I got zero feedback on my work and tended to assume the worst, mainly that I was too slow. It led me to overwork, and the thing was, nobody noticed or stopped me. In an ideal world, I would've had a manager or mentor to confide in about my insecurities before they snowballed. To an extent, I knew what I was signing up for when I joined a small company with no clear organization. But still, it could've been better, and eventually it did when the management structure got built out.

Now, the tricky part about this sort of insecurity for me was that I felt like I couldn't talk to my coworkers about it. If I told someone about my worries and they said I was fine, what if they're just being nice? And if I told a manager about my worries, what if they think I'm incompetent? I believed that talking about the problem would lead to negative consequences, so I chose not to say anything.

In the end, I really should've said something earlier. I eventually worked up the courage to say, ""Hey, I've been feeling pretty stressed out because I worry I'm not doing enough.""

""Well if you're worried you're not doing enough, then why aren't you doing more?"" was what I feared they would say.

""Oh my gosh, I had no idea you felt that way. I'm sorry I didn't give feedback earlier, you're actually doing great. Keep it up!"" was what they actually said to me.

Now, I was lucky that the company had a healthy culture and that my coworkers were awesome. I don't know whether your company is toxic or healthy, so perhaps you do have reason to believe people would react poorly to your seeking feedback. But assuming the people you work with are reasonable, then it might help to find a manager or coworker familiar with your work who can give guidance on this sort of thing.",2164,testimonial injustice,part wonder symptom poor mentorship speculate ideally manager give continuous useful feedback especially 1 year career fair feel like almost every new grad know go similar struggle know well get first software job college get zero feedback work tend assume bad mainly slow lead overwork thing nobody notice stop ideal world would manager mentor confide insecurity snowball extent know sign join small company clear organization still could better eventually management structure get build tricky part sort insecurity felt like talk coworkers tell someone worry say fine nice tell manager worry think incompetent believe talk problem would lead negative consequence choose say anything end really say something early eventually worked courage say hey feeling pretty stress worry enough well worried enough fear would say oh gosh idea felt way sorry give feedback early actually great keep actually say lucky company healthy culture coworkers awesome know whether company toxic healthy perhaps reason believe people would react poorly seek feedback assume people work reasonable might help find manager coworker familiar work give guidance sort thing,"advice, tech, need, work, feel",0.7550567649338624,"incompetent, cynicism, exceed, lecturing, taunt",0.5199999999999999,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.6412638524859746

I am always cautious to not be alone with people I don't really know and try to go always with a small group of friends, other women, or queer folks. 

I did have bad experiences with people trying to make unwanted sexual advances (nice euphemism!) or trolls trying to dox me. But I always had this wall of friends/allies around me that cut them early. If you don't feed the trolls, they usually forget about you. It is not fun to troll someone who muted you and is not even reading you.

For my online presence, I just keep a firm blocking/report/muting policy whenever someone starts annoying me. 

Specifically for my personal tech blog, I have a spam filter that also filters most trolls. If/when your blog becomes so big the task of reviewing comments becomes annoying, you can always turn down anonymous comments. I use Wordpress for my personal blog, but I also write in many other platforms that have similar features. Worst case: turn comments off. But don't worry, your blog will still have a loooong way before you have so many comments this is an issue.

At the beginning I used pseudonyms, but that was useless because I couldn't build a strong personal brand. I wanted to have a background I could show and people could find me. As in, when sending a proposal to a call for papers, have some background of who I am and why they should choose me.

The key is building your crowd of allies around you that defend you if needed. And if you don't have strong allies: block, report, mute, turn comments off until you have allies. Don't let that stop you! Your voice is important.

Anyway, it is always a good practice to hide your intimate/personal details and never post dangerous things. Like, don't post your address. Be purposely vague on where you live (or write on purpose misleading hints). Don't post your phone number. Don't share anything that could be used to steal your identity. Change your passwords frequently. Use strong passwords and two factor authentication. Etc... etc...

It’s 40 hours a week for a year. I really tried to focus from the beginning this time and do everything perfectly and I must admit that I am really behind on the topics that we are learning and the exercises. To be honest since chatGPT came out I have just been using that for the bi-weekly assessments and the exercises we have to hand in. Four months in I am having a super hard time focusing and no matter how hard I try, I can get distracted by anything and miss big portions of the lectures. Then when we get the exercises I have no idea what to do and get frustrated so quickly and honestly just give up. 

(Additionally I am chronically ill and dealing with a lot of pain every day. Also I had to move soon after the classes started and am still wrapped up in renovations for the new place. But I don’t want to use any of this as excuses.)

In the past I have dropped out of one bachelor, finished another and also have gotten a certificate for a 2-year program. I only found out I had ADHD after all of this happened. While getting these degrees I would procrastinate a lot and feel very guilt for not learning anything. I still feel guilty for only finishing things in the last second and I doubt my abilities a lot. I wanted this time to be different and it isn’t :( 

(Due to becoming chronically ill I won’t be able to use any of my current degrees. That’s why I need to go to school again to land a wfh opportunity. I don’t know if the pressure of this is helping my learning or not.)

How can I get back into the topics we are learning? I dropped out at “functions and classes” and now we have gotten to “testing” and I am completely lost. I still attend the classes every day and am logged in online but I honestly see no use in doing this, because I understand nothing and would need to catch up first. I can read and correct the code of my classmates without any issues because my analytical brain is made for these kinds of things, but I could never code myself :(

I see others have mentioned medication already, and I also highly recommend that if you are able to get it and your body can handle it. But here is some other stuff that I do, because the medication (sadly) isn't a cure.

- first of all: you sound burnt out, so make sure to schedule time to relax and do things you enjoy that doesn't require a lot of mental work. The reason you should schedule it, is because it allows you to not feel guilty about being unproductive. Breaks are actually very productive!

- make a nice space to work in if you have room for it. I have a desk and a comfy office chair at home, and I have a blanket over my legs while I work because it reduces the chances of me getting up and wandering around.

- noice cancelling headphones or earplugs with music that is not distracting (I use a calm jazz-playlist on Spotify) helps me get ""in the zone"".

- if you get stuck, either ask for help or move on to another task if possible. If you're anything like me, you'll just end up getting overwhelmed and discouraged if you keep getting the same thing wrong over and over. It's ok to not do everything in order.

- do not ""over-schedule"" as an attempt to be more productive. This can be very harmful if you already struggle with motivation and you might not be able to keep up with your schedule.

- find someone you feel comfortable with asking for help. It is super helpful to me when I can sit next to someone and ask ""dumb questions"" without feeling judged. 

- this is a challenging one, but: try to enjoy what you are doing! I don't know exactly what type of assignments you are getting, but I found motivation by thinking that someone else might learn something from my code (I post my assignments on GitHub). It's easier to understand your own code if you try to explain it to someone else.

- be kind to yourself! It sounds like you're trying very hard, and you have a lot going on, so don't make it even harder by being cruel to yourself. 

This turned out to be a long comment, but hopefully at least some of it is helpful! I also want to add that your study program might offer accommodations, like extended deadlines, recordings of the lectures, etc, since you have ADHD. Good luck, I hope things works out for you!

Ever see the movie [Matilda](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117008/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4)?  I loved that movie when I was a kid.  Matilda, the main character, is a girl who is growing up in an abusive family.  She turned to books as an escape to get away from her family filling her head with fantasy.  

This was and still is deeply relatable to me.  I grew up in an abusive family and turned to creativity as my outlet.  Instead of reading books I sewed and created music, but my largest love was that of programming.  When I was 8 I taught myself how to write code.  Writing code unlocked a canvas where I could not only paint anything I wanted on the screen, I could make it interactive.  I could make animation and sound in software.  I could make games.  And despite not liking to play video games, I loved making them.  It was like drawing, but much more.

Programming at its heart is creativity.  It's bringing something new into the world of your own design.  If you skip that part, you lose the point.  Using ChatGPT to do your homework for you, you lose the reason to write code to begin with.

Eventually you've got to ask yourself, ""Is writing code something you want to be doing for 40 hours a week?""  I wouldn't answer that immediately.  I don't think you've given it a fair shake.

When I went to school my family told me, ""Take all of the classes you can.  See what you like and what you don't like.""  That was wonderful advice.  Following this philosophy, don't just give programming a fair shake, try to give all of your classes a fair shake.  Don't just hurry through and burn through your homework trying to finish it as fast as possible.  Sit down and try to saver it, to enjoy the projects you've been given.  See not just what classes you like and dislike, but what parts of projects you like and dislike.  The more resolution you have into your own enjoyment the better you can find future classes and projects you are more likely to enjoy.

In summary, perhaps take a step back, slow down, and try to savor the creative process of writing a new program.  ""It's about the journey not the destination.""  That is, it's not about the grade.  It's not about finishing the homework.  It's about learning to enjoy doing the homework itself.  You can't enjoy homework if you're rushing to finish it.  You can't enjoy homework if it's too easy.  You can't enjoy homework if it's too hard.

Programming is a lot like math in that concepts build on top of each other.  It's pretty hard to do multiplication without knowing addition.  To write tests you need to understand functions.  If you want to not only succeed at this, but do well and enjoy yourself, you're going to have to go back to functions.

Ask yourself, ""What are the benefits of writing functions?""  There are multiple answers to this.  The more answers you know the better mastery you have of functions.

It's a thing with communication. If your work is highly visible, people want to tell you how they think you should proceed. If your work is something they are interested in, they are thinking of how they would do things in your shoes. I myself like to do the same to people, I once taught a chef about different kinds of bread. I still cringe when I think about that one. Top sportspeople have the whole country telling them how to do their jobs all day everyday.... It's just part of life. 

I don't take into account things people say. People say random crap to fill the silence and it's usually their awkwardness that makes them do that. 

What annoys me is when I'm asking for help and people tell me things I've already tried and which don't work, and then don't listen when I say I've already tried those. I had a boss who would try to pick flaws in how I did all the things he suggested and tell me to do them again instead of giving me better ideas. It was incredibly frustrating. I haven't experienced it in any other workplace before or since. 

I dealt with that by documenting more and being more aggressive with what I needed and telling instead of asking. 

There's no point being pissed about things that don't directly affect getting things done. If it's wasting your time, you can direct people to cut to the chase. I have ADHD and get distracted if people go on on irrelevant tangents so I usually just interrupt and say ""yeah yeah, what I'm really looking at is..."". 

That said, if someone tries to explain things to me, I listen. I was a bit of a know it all as a teenager, and listening to how other people think about things was interesting to me and helped me chill the fuck out. Having even a slightly different perspective on how to carry out the same task made me more flexible in my thinking.

I also have ADHD and a terrible memory, and of course it an introvert. This is why thinking of answers in advance is very helpful. I spent the first half of my career undiagnosed and unmedicated for it and it was extremely difficult to engage in the work most days, and I couldn’t have answered these questions well because I was legitimately not doing the work consistently. I was the kind of person I want to weed out now.

I always read the resumes and ask related questions. 
I started to believe in this format however after working with multiple people who do absolutely nothing on a project, literally sit at the keyboard moving the mouse for 8 hours a day, and then can list the same experience as I can on their resume. I’ve found these people using questions like this, and asking about resume listed projects. Please do speak to a project listed on the resume when asked these questions, it’s just a phrasing issue.

As far as the probationary period, it’s very expensive to onboard someone and replace them every few months and that time is spent with someone incompetent in the role making zero progress. Probationary period is the last resort, not meant to just take in someone who should’ve been easily weeded out in the interview when they couldn’t describe the basic details of a project they claimed to have spent months on. The good answer may have sounded canned because I just made it up of course, but in an interview we don’t care at all if it sounds canned. We only care if you sound like you know what you’re talking about and actually did some work.

It can be frustrating as the interviewee to not feel trusted just based on what’s written on your resume, but consider that the interviewer is doing a dozen interviews a week and needs a consistent format to compare applicants, and has also seen tons and tons of people exaggerating their skills and experience on their resumes, if not straight up lying.

I am about to start my senior year of college at a fairly prestigious US university majoring in cognitive science and minoring in computer science. I'm currently trying to figure out what the heck I'm going to do after I graduate and I feel like I don't even know where to begin or even who to ask as my career advisors at my school have so far proven useless.

I am interested in software engineering and have really enjoyed my courses for my minor. Cognitive science is a relatively new field and I know a lot of people haven't heard of it but basically it's an interdisciplinary approach to studying the mind encompassing psychology, neuro, philosophy, and cs! My major is focusing in CS and I will have taken as much CS coursework as a normal CS grad would've by the time I graduate. I've taken an AI course and will take an NLP course for my major.

I thought I was maybe interested in academia and spent the past two summers (including this one) as a research assistant at a psychology lab at my school. I also work in a neuroscience lab under a fairly famous computer scientist (but it is neuro research which I know is sorta confusing) and that work will culminate in my senior thesis. Ultimately, I've decided research isn't for me and I'd like to go into industry.

I find myself now staring down graduation with a lot of research experience and not much computer science experience outside of school. I've used python and a bit of matlab in my work but not much. I've been trying to study LeetCode and prepare for interviews but I find myself feeling really unmotivated and hopeless as I look at my resume with no relevant experience. On top of that, I don't have a clear idea of what sorts of cs jobs/internships I should apply to. My knowledge of what sorts of tech jobs out there is really limited. I've thought about looking into program management but I don't even really understand what that is lol and looking it up hasn't been that helpful.

I genuinely really enjoy what I'm learning & considering I had no background in IT, I have honestly been doing great with keeping up & am actually ahead with some assessments compared to others in my classes (& of coarse there's others ahead of me too).

 My issue though is that whenever I'm in group projects or group labs there's always at least one or more guys that will make my input feel inferior, either by usually trying to boss me around with how I contribute my share of the work instead of allowing me to contribute my part myself, or by dismissing my suggestions completely, or sometimes even dismissing my suggestions & then 5 minutes later coming up with those very same suggestions as if it was their own idea. This is especially glaring during troubleshooting exercises. 

For a long while I've tried to tell myself that it's nothing personal & that it isn't because I'm a woman, or continue to make excuses for my poor treatment from other students in my mind, but it's becoming harder to justify as time goes on, especially since I never see these guys treating each other the way some of them passive-aggressively treat me. I have worked in many different industries before deciding on the IT life path & have never experienced this much of a 'boys club' vibe before. Though to be fair I have also had alot of extremely engaging & pleasant learning experiences with all my professors & a handful of the other male students. 

Is this attitude I'm experiencing from some guys less likely to happen once I'm actually qualified & out in the workforce? Or are these kind of experiences a  reoccurring theme in the industry for women?

I wish I'd known about IDEs. I literally wrote code in a text editor for MONTHS. Then I found Codepen.io, which can be useful, like I used it to dbl check the styles on some html I was writing in an AWS SES template, but it wasn't until I'd been making little frontend web apps for local businesses for about 6mo that I learned what a dang IDE was. 

In general hidden skills are a big one. It's not hard to Google yourself up some resources on html, css, Python, whathaveyou. But often said resources assume you know a lot of ancillary stuff like git. I freaking used Google Drive and its version control because I had no idea what git was or that is existed. Whoever said how to put in breakpoints and debug, that's a big one too. And in both IDEs as well as from a command line application like Terminal. Oh and also just wtf the command line is in general. There are so many things I can do much much more quickly from Terminal now that I know what's up, but for a while I just thought GUIs were the only option. Like what else would you use to see files and directories and stuff? GUI tools in IDEs are pretty powerful, but it's also powerful to know how to open the python interpreter, wtf bash is and what environment variables are, how to quickly edit something in vim, etc. 

And the last one I'd say, which I think is overlooked is ""can you actually get a job doing this?""

If there are close to zero entry level roles either in a given area or in remote postings in a similar timezone, shit is gonna suck after they learn skills and take a year or more to get a single interview. Personally I think writing css is only marginally more fun than getting a pap smear. But it was a helluva lot easier to get a frontend role and then transition (when and where I was looking when I started anyway).

You came in there hoping to learn, and you can't provide as much value as a mid to senior level software developer, so the best thing you can do as a junior is to be open to learn, show you are engaged, communicate well, respect everyone around you, and be professional and mature.

But now you see that the overbearing male who pushes himself into everything is eclipsing your professionalism. 

I don't know what to say to you other than this is what we talk about when we say tech is always heavily biased towards men. And at the end of the day you can't control your manager's bias, they chose the male.

What you can do is to start analysing how your CV would look with this internship's description on it, and focus on the projects that are available to you that give you better material on your CV. At the end of the day you don't really want to work for the company, right? So make the most of the internship as it is, and better luck next time.

Another thing is that just because your manager doesn't give you programming projects doesn't mean you can't ask the non-tech people you work with if they don't need some help automating tasks, and then write some shell scripts for them, and add them to some company repo. I don't know if this is possible for you within the limits of your internship.

All i can say is I commiserate. I was an intern in a company where 2 male developers got ""downgraded"" to tester because they couldn't handle development, and the other male developer got fast-tracked to a senior engineering role which he couldn't handle either and ended up being a senior doing config work. Ultimately I was the only female and was capable of  handling whatever they threw at me, and got nothing but shitty engineering work and management not listening to what I said I more interested in doing.

But I took whatever experience I could and moved onwards and away. These male managers cannot see their own bias, even if they're nice guys. They just cannot see that they automatically prefer and reward men and see women as simultaneously useless enough to not be given technically high-visibility work, but useful enough to be give equally complex but low-visibility work.

This is mostly a rant but advice is appreciated. I have a teammate who is very, for lack of a better term, annoying. I’m pretty new in my career and he’s been in the industry for about 20+ years maybe more. For instance, he had a wrong version of an application installed. I feel like common sense would tell him to uninstall it and install the right one, instead he’s asking me what to do (I tell him to uninstall and install the correct version). He also asks redundant questions such as how to do things that I know he has done multiple times before because I’ve answered the same question multiple times before. He also gets obviously aggravated if I don’t respond within a certain time (like within 3-5 minutes) asking “are you here” repeatedly and stating the length of time he had to wait for a response as if I don’t have my own work to do 🙄

I have no intentions on having any non-work relationships with people I work directly work with (I just don’t feel comfortable with that) but if I have to make small talk about their dog I’ll do it. But he has shown me pictures of his son shirtless and that made me really uncomfortable in which I gave as little of a response to it as I possibly can (an ok and a nod. Barely a smile). 

I also feel as if he watches me which makes me even more uncomfortable. During a meeting I was just reading an article which made me laugh and he goes on to ask me what I’m laughing about in the middle of the of the other teammates discussion making it super awkward. In another instance, I was laughing with a couple of friends on my way back from lunch and when I got to my computer he pings me asking if it was my birthday because he saw me smiling. 

These are just examples I can think of at the top of my head and I have been keeping records ever since the shirtless son pic but I just got a new manager and I really don’t feel comfortable with any of the higher ups. (I went from having majority women managers and now they are all men so I’m even more hesitant). All of these incidents put together, I have come to genuinely hate this man.

They form their own groups and guess what, I am left out of it. I have tried to engage with them but it's clear the conversation is awkward and the energy has changed.

I remember one time I joined a conversation where this guy would obnoxiously look at me any time he said the word ""guys"" and say ""AND GIRLS TOO!!!"" like he's freaked out I will be offended.

Men need to learn how to actually talk to women like they are actual people they want to engage with.

A huge issue I have at my job is how freaking lonely I am. I have NO friends at work. I just learned that among the 500 or so people in my department only 45 are women. We have NO senior architects who are women, and most of that 45 consist of administrative assistants or project managers. Any of the actual tech teams generally have no women. And this is a problem not because I'm a woman and need the company of women to function at work, but because the men are so fucking weird and offputting when I am around and they stare at me like I'm some alien race that it would be refreshing to actually be able to talk to someone who sees me as a real person and viable work relationship.

I also am \~29 and started when I was 25, and I learned REAL FAST not to wear heels or dresses or dress in anything that doesn't completely cover up my body. I wear oversized sweatshirts and have adopted a pretty androgynous wardrobe because it's the only time I get treated as a real person. I had an older guy on one of my old teams ask for my help with something in the data center and I was really happy someone actually needed my help (I was an intern at the time). I mentioned it to a coworker and he said ""Yeah I wonder why he wanted your help..."" in this sarcastic tone (I happened to be wearing a very modest dress and heels) as if he just wanted attention from me because of how I look. It was so insulting and I just dress like a hobo now. ANYTHING to distract men from the fact that I am an actual woman.

What should I do?",dthpock,,"Currently we have a small team as we are building up to a larger team. Two junior engineers including myself, our boss, the pm, and two brand new seniors. The stack we're working on is somewhat different from other teams, so it's difficult to compare myself to others directly. 

I did bring up to the PM that the project he passed off as his was a clone of the senior female's project. While he did make some changes (variable names), the core feature of the project is an exact clone. It is not a matter of reading the diff, there are no differences to read at all. The PM did not seem overly concerned by this, he just shrugged. I do not know if the other junior has been passing this off as his to people than me, but I have in turn been referring to it as 'his script' and 'his code' to others for months. 

I had a meeting with my boss yesterday and a follow-up today. I was straightforward and said I was worried that there was a problem with my performance, given the other junior's harsh comments and my general lack of high priority tasks. He said he does not think I have a performance problem at all, and that he sees me as pulling 50% of the weight on the team, at an equal level with the other junior. He does consider my tasks high priority. He said he has received only positive feedback from the seniors I've worked with. He acknowledged that the other junior is pushing more code, but said he does not expect me to work nights and weekends the way the other junior is. He said he would talk with the other junior about teamwork and tone. 

Today, he came by and said 'don't worry, I told him it's not what was said, it's how it was heard'.

But *it is what was said*. He accused me of hardcoding when I did not, and it is easily proven I did not. He accused me of closing unfinished tasks when I did not (it is easy to check the history, they were never closed). He tore apart my pull requests and blocked me from merging, slowing down my progress. The PM himself was furious about this last week. In fact, the PM was the one who originally raised the complaint. I was dealing with it silently and he got himself involved. 

When I *calmly*, *casually*, and *immediately* pointed this out to the PM, he responded with 'you're crazy' for continuing to complain when I 'won' and 'the jury is on your side' so I should let it be.

I started around the same time as another junior developer. Very quickly, it became pretty obvious that he was putting in more hours and getting more done. He was working nights and weekends, and I was working a standard 40 hours. We were the only two engineers on a new team, and our boss was working on staffing with seniors. 

About a month in, the other junior engineer sent me an inappropriate message over slack, coming on to me. I screen capped it and sent it to our pm, who reacted very swiftly and got our boss involved. The other junior was warned, and we both had several separate meetings to make sure we were okay working together.

Because he was working more, the other junior quickly began getting the higher priority assignments. The 'flagship' assignments of the team, while I was put on smaller tasks. As a result, I learned much less and fell even further behind, as my tasks were repetitive and working with things I'd already learned. Several times I asked for higher priority tasks, and when our sprint reviews came around, the work I'd done on them was often ignored or not even reviewed at all. At one point I'd spent three days on a script to do something new, and when it came time to review it in our sprint demo, my boss texted through it. 

This other junior forked a project from the only female senior developer, and passed it off as his. I didn't realize this until last week when I found hers on the corporate github. I was given this project and told to enhance it. These enhancements were categorized as 'bug fixes', though they weren't bugs at all. As such, I got no 'points' for them in our sprints. Again, he was given the flagship tasks. On top of this, I was given tasks like 'socialize with other team to build work relationships' and just 'research'. I felt like I was disproportionately expected to schedule new meetings and attend meetings. None of these 'soft' tasks were captured in our sprint. 

At the same time, I became fairly demotivated and began slacking on these 'bugs'. The senior engineer who reviewed my code was absolutely hostile and rude to work with, and I needed his help to complete some of the tasks. They sat unfinished. 

Last week we finally onboarded two senior engineers. One was very slow to set up (much slower than I was), and is clearly struggling. Despite this, he was given another high priority task. I was given more 'bug fixes'. 

At the end of the week, the other junior dev went through my closed sprint tasks and left hostile reviews on them. Saying that I wasn't getting enough done, I wasn't coding to standard, and I was closing tasks that were incomplete. Our PM locked the thread and called him in to talk about it, saying he was not speaking to me the way a teammate should, and he was being unprofessional. 

Over the weekend the senior dev went through and completed the bugs I had left undone. He sent his diff to the other junior for review, bypassing me completely.

In some ways, I feel it's my fault that we're at this point, because I didn't put in the extra hours and truly try to compete for the higher priority tasks. At the same time, I feel when I did try I was ignored completely. I think very quickly I was given less respect and written off. I feel like I've been spinning my wheels for the last five months, working all day but getting almost nothing of import done. I've learned a lot, but I have almost nothing to show it. 

My PM called me in to talk about the other dev's rude code reviews on old tasks. He said he considered that workplace bullying and would be reporting him to our boss. He, along with another senior engineer who I've mostly learned from, have both said they thought I've been doing a good job. 

I feel completely humiliated by all of this and am ready to throw in the hat. Should I abandon ship, or try to prove myself. Leaving feels like quitting, but I'm dreading work Monday.

From the sound of things someone doing your role at most companies would be titled ""Engineering manager"", and it's definitely a skillset that is in demand, so I think your concerns about being hireable because of this type of experience are unfounded. IMO what's more important is whether you would personally prefer to be in the trenches coding more, or whether you're okay with settling into the management track and just have problems with your current company / environment. 

If you would feel more comfortable as an individual contributor, you could try talking to your boss to see if there's ways to accommodate that. IME though, companies can be resistant to this because good engineering managers are frankly really hard to find, so changing companies might be the easier route. 6 months of management experience is not really going to hurt your chances of landing another individual contributor role, and will likely be a bonus at many companies (especially if you're open to a 'tech lead' type of role where you would be doing some management alongside individual contributions to the code).

As far as coming out goes, I don't have a lot of advice on how to navigate that, but personally I was feeling similarly unmotivated and also wanted a fresh start, so I ended up leaving the company I was working at before I did so. I tried to find a smaller company that was big on inclusivity, then came out after being hired (I was also coming out as trans, so not the exact same thing, but hopefully close enough to be relevant). In retrospect I think that was a good way to do things and much less fraught than if I'd tried to do it before leaving, though I did end up leaving the new company after a few months for unrelated reasons. 

I agree with the other commenter that you may be facing some impostor syndrome here, it was certainly a problem for me when I started doing management, but as long as you're listening to feedback from your team and superiors it'll usually be very apparent if you're actually not doing a good job. This is always hard to deal with, the only advice I have is the cliched 'fake it till you make it', and to try to remember that self-criticism is only valuable if it's actionable, otherwise it can safely be ignored.",2371,testimonial injustice,sound like several thing go think might help tease apart little bit sound thing someone role company would title engineering manager definitely skillset demand think concern hireable type experience unfounded imo important whether would personally prefer trench cod whether okay settle management track problem current company environment would feel comfortable individual contributor could try talk boss see way accommodate ime though company resistant good engineering manager frankly really hard find change company might easier route 6 month management experience really go hurt chance land another individual contributor role likely bonus many company especially open tech lead type role would management alongside individual contribution code far come go lot advice navigate personally feel similarly unmotivated also want fresh start end leave company work try find small company big inclusivity come hire also come trans exact thing hopefully close enough relevant retrospect think good way thing much less fraught try leave though end leave new company month unrelated reason agree commenter may face impostor syndrome certainly problem start management long listen feedback team superior usually apparent actually good job always hard deal advice cliched fake till make try remember self criticism valuable actionable otherwise safely ignore,"feel, like, manager, engineering, job",0.6481628595693302,"tease, condescending, accused, defeated, outdo",0.5199999999999997,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.603661668463903

At the beginning it was exciting and difficult. By about the end of sophomore, start of Jr year, it was just plain difficult. 

I'm bad at test taking and my classmates were making excellent grades while studying half as much as me. I had to buckle down and push through. I honestly felt like I was dumb and could never measure up to all the effortless A's I was seeing.

I went to every free tutoring session at my school I could find. I would write my email on the board in my class rooms and put "" study group: meeting up in x room at the library, email or come on x day at x time to study for x exam."" Sometimes no one would show and I'd take that time to focus by myself. But usually people would show up that I didn't know. By the end of the hour or so I had made another study budy, after a week it would be 3 study buddies then 5. Some of These connections were just like me, others who passed easily, became my friends and drug me through my courses clinging for dear life. 

Make an effort to connect with others, be kind, and contribute to your study groups in whatever way you can. I took a ton of notes so even if I didn't know the material well I'd trade/share my notes for another person explaining any questions I had about the notes. It was a sort of collaboration of people and knowledge that I threw together every semester and it worked fantastic. 

A passing grade is a passing grade so just take it and try to keep moving forward. I beat myself up about it and almost quit my studies in Jr year. At that point I had already taken student loans and I didn't want to waste all that money so I just kept chugging along. 

I am SO GLAD I saw it through!!

 In a professional environment it is much easier. You get the time and resources to research your projects, make mistakes, write and rewrite code. You have a whole team of other devs working with you and tossing around ideas. 

You get the breathing room to focus on a few topics. Rather than having a million classes unrelated and all with pass or fail guillotines hanging over your head.

If you have the willpower I suggest just working as hard as you can to make it through school because when it's over it will pay off.

Prepping now for the Core 2 on Monday. I took the Mike Meyers course on Straighter Line, which is really just some videos, a digital textbook, and some graded exams. The book is available on Amazon and a lot of his videos are on YouTube, but I didn't know that before I started.  I also recommend the Professor Messer videos on YouTube and Jason Dion's practice exams on Udemy.

My best advice is to really set aside time to study, at least several times a week. Money was my motivator.  I spent money on the course, and I was going to be charged again for the second month. The book had 28 chapters.  I made a goal to study one per day. I watched the accompanying videos, took notes, made flash cards, and took the chapter tests. My pace was too quick for the labs, but Mike Meyers' book has some good ones to try.

It is a lot to learn, and the scope of the exam is huge. You don't know what questions you are going to get within those objectives, so you need to learn them all. There are some things you need to memorize,  but most things you need to learn. If you are working right now, it is going to take some time. Many people take months to prepare.  Just be consistent.  I was overwhelmed when I first looked at the material, but I just took it one chapter at a time.

I also tried to use and talk about what I was learning. I told my husband about it every night. When I studied how power works, I got my husband's multimeter and plug tester and tried it out. When the book talked about programs you could download and virtual box, I tried that out. When I got to networking,  I decided to upgrade my internet, ran a new ethernet cable, and configured a new wireless access point. When I got to the command line, I tried most of the commands on my own computer. Using what you learn really helps to solidify it for you.

If you really feel like you can't start at the A+, try the ITF+. I haven't taken it, but I have heard it will give you a less broad starting point. The Google IT Support Certification is pretty good. I don't feel it was necessarily easier because some parts were more in depth. It is much more focused though, so much less material. You might try that. There is no big certification exam at the end, so it was less intimidating to me, though I took them both at the same time.

I was on a team that was loosely divided between front end and back end devs. Once management changed, we sat down individually with the new guy to discuss what we wanted to be working on, and I expressed that I wanted to be front end, specifically working on UI and accessibility. They were like ""awesome, that's great, we love it."" And for about a month it went great. 

Then I got assigned a ticket that ended up taking me on a wild debugging journey through the backend code (which I was relatively unfamiliar with), two different APIs, and our extensive and complex database. The problem wound up not even being related to the code... In terms of man hours, this took me about 12 days. And that was apparently too long. My male counterparts, both of whom had recently gone through boot camps as well, were working on similar projects which took them similar amounts of time. They were told ""it's okay if it takes that long if you're learning something!"" I was put on a PIP.

My male colleagues were fucking FURIOUS. Not that I wasn't too, but it helped that they saw how blatant he was about this and about not wanting me in the team. This was far from an isolated incident, but we don't have years to discuss his douchebaggery. Every single dev in my office went to HR and registered formal complaints. I went in with recorded conversations (legal in my state) of him degrading me. In the end, after they knew I had contacted a lawyer, they basically let my PIP run out and ignored me, waiting for me to get another job so they wouldn't have to fire me and risk being taken to court.

My HR rep was useless. After 2-1/2 years of stellar reviews from multiple managers, she believed the new guy that I was useless and in 6 months unlearned everything I knew. I made three formal complaints about him, as did others, but nepotism kept him there and drove us all away. In those 6 months, our Denver-based dev shop went from 25 employees of all levels to...one. One guy still works there. The rest are now in the California office.

I've been a tomboy my whole life. I've worked in bike shops and ski shops and experienced my fair share of sexism.

I'm 26 and quit my full stack SWE job last year to take care of my mental health and my family, and I'm feeling terrified about going back. For context, I graduated in 2018 with a CS degree and joined a mid-sized healthcare startup. We went through layoffs and the company was about to be shut down after a year, so I left and joined a larger startup. With COVID, everyone in my cohort was laid off except for me and one other person :( I was switched around to 4 different teams in my 2 years there and never got the chance to feel comfortable in any one area of our tech stack. My title was Associate Software Engineer at both companies.

After moving back home and over a year in therapy, I'm feeling more stable and ready to return to work. I technically have 3 years of industry experience, but I still feel very junior/associate level! I've started to read up on data structures/algorithms on Geeksforgeeks, attempt Leetcode easy problems, and follow a MERN stack tutorial (my previous experience was with Ruby on Rails). I know that it'll take me several months to get back to up speed and I'm trying to trust the process. However, I started imagining what would happen if I actually got a job as a software engineer, and realized I'm really, really dreading it.  All the fears of imposter syndrome, little moments of sexism, and making friends only to have them get laid off came flooding back 😥

I used to be very mission-driven, but now just generally feel incompetent and uninspired by coding. I'm not sure if this is the path for me, or if I should try going back to school or do a bootcamp or something. Should I just find work at a larger, more stable company? Does software engineering just feel like a grind until you actually get better at it?

I decided on CS for financial stability and the flexibility of being able to work in different industries. I thought I could do it as long as I was working with good people--I loved being part of the DEI and sustainability committees at my last job, and planning social events for my team (although maybe this contributed to burnout). I thought about leaving tech to be a teacher or a therapist, and have an interest in biology as well, but feel like it would be a waste of my CS degree.

I’ve been sort of lurking around this sub for a little while, and I was hoping to get some advice/encouragement?

I’m a senior in CS at a good public uni, and next semester is my last one. However, over the last four years I’ve noticed that my feelings of being an imposter have grown steadily worse, and it may have affected my grades. I have a terrible GPA (~2.5), and I have to get at least a C++ average in the rest of my major classes in order to graduate. In other words, I am the living embodiment of “ C’s get degrees”.  I’ve done an internship at a fairly well known company, and I work part time on campus doing web development, but I haven’t really done any side projects. Whenever I come close to doing non-class coding I get this overwhelming fear that my code is/is going to be terrible and not optimized well enough and just *mediocre*. That I am mediocre, and that I won’t be able to get a job. Then that just starts me down a dark hole of self-pity and worry about being able to pay off my student loans, and so on and so forth.  The only classes that I consistently get A’s and B’s in are my classes for my English minor, so I’m worried that I wasted money and time pursuing a CS degree despite my love of coding and problem solving. 

At work I feel completely incompetent the majority of the time. Despite being the senior employee, my boss gives all of the ‘interesting’ or ‘challenging’ projects to my male coworker, and the few times that I was able to take the more difficult assignments, they were all cancelled or used to goad another department into doing their jobs and then cancelled. Over the course of three or so years there I’ve essentially only done bug fixes and refactoring that was almost immediately refactored by my male coworker again. It just feels like nothing that I do is good enough, nor appreciated, and that just further fuels my certainty that I am incompetent and that my code is terrible.  To make matters worse, I feel like whenever I walk into work I become noticeably dumber or something. At the moment it seems like my biggest completed project will be establishing and writing all of the documentation for a web app that has been in active deployment/development for more than 6 years.

Has anyone else had this experience? Any advice for how to deal with these problems and what to look for in post-grad positions?

I just started a master’s program in the social sciences (have a BA in the same) and I had felt strongly for the past year or so (before starting) that I needed to get a PhD and become a professor. I was working in admin support roles before this and felt unfulfilled/not respected for a couple of years.

I also did this program to get more clarity and to learn quantitative methods for social sciences, since I don’t have a strong background in that. I do love the field I study, but I’ve realized over the past month or so that this path would make my life way more unstable - i.e. difficulty even finding a non-adjunct job, being far away from my boyfriend and family when i want to settle down, the disrespectfully low pay. 

I’m realizing that learning computer programming / data analytics while still in my current program would be a good pathway for me to transition into a more stable career that is still intellectually stimulating and has better hours (i would not aim for FAANG given my lack of background) + better prospects for my short and long-term finances. I know basic HTML and am currently learning Javascript and find it really enjoyable. I wasn’t the biggest fan of math growing up but have grown to enjoy it and feel more confident in my ability to do it. Love the problem/puzzle solving involved in coding, plus the fact that you’re helping to create something. Emotionally, I do feel kind of guilty for realizing how much more important financial/family stability is to me than feeling intellectually validated by others in an academic career. 

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice for how to transition into CS from a social sciences (or non-STEM) background?

girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:13,2023-03-11 8:45,[deleted],Post,Job hunting. Job I like is different than what I originally wanted. Do I take it?,11okkzb,,"I applied to a front end developer role. After talking to the manager, it sounds like I’ll be exposed to a lot more things than what the job description listed. Like, instead of a purely React developer, I’ll be working with tools like Google Cloud Platform, Salesforce, Tag Manager, web scraping, stuff like that. So things that are related to web development, but not fully front end work.

When I started my job search, I thought I wanted 100% React, but this role is really intriguing me.

The company is a marketing agency, something I’ve been wanting to try out. They are transitioning their digital department from contractors to full-time, and I’ll be one of the first full-time people on the team. The manager and I really connected, and the people I’ve met are really kind and down to earth. They seem super happy. Their clients are made up of a specific industry that I care about, and I would love exposure to. As time goes on, seems like there’s potential for this role to turn into a management role, which is also something that has interested me.

And honestly? I’ve been writing code for some time now. It might be interesting to branch out and learn some new skills that aren’t code-specific.

My heart is fully set on this role, but I’m hesitating. Am I wearing rose colored glasses? I just quit a job last week (after less than two months) where the manager kept implying I didn’t know my field. He kept insinuating I catfished him in the interview process. It has fucked with my confidence. What if I’m running away from a pure front end developer role because he got in my head that I’m incompetent? What if I take this role and it’s not what I made it out to be? How will this affect my career going forward, if I spend less time developing in, like, React?

Oh, and then there’s salary. This salary is the same as my current role. It’s already good money, but I’m getting other interviews with a $40k+ raise. I really don’t need this extra money, but I feel a lot of guilt taking a job that pays less than other opportunities. Those roles also don’t interest me like this one.  Those would very much feel like just a paycheck, and I don’t think I would be challenged. Those roles are also at start ups and I don’t think I want to work in that environment. This new place has been around for a VERY long time.

This feels like it could be SO much different than the jobs I’ve had in the past, but there’s a little voice in my head saying “maybe that’s not a bad thing.” Do I trust my gut?",2561,testimonial injustice,apply front end developer role talk manager sound like expose lot thing job description list like instead purely react developer work tool like google cloud platform salesforce tag manager web scrap stuff like thing relate web development fully front end work start job search think want 100 react role really intriguing company marketing agency something want try transition digital department contractor full time one first full time people team manager really connect people meet really kind earth seem super happy client make specific industry care would love exposure time go seem like potential role turn management role also something interested honestly write code time might interest branch learn new skill code specific heart fully set role hesitate wear rise colored glass quit job last week less two month manager keep imply know field keep insinuate catfished interview process fuck confidence run away pure front end developer role get head incompetent take role make affect career go forward spend less time develop like react oh salary salary current role already good money get interview 40k raise really need extra money feel lot guilt take job pay less opportunity role also interest like one would much feel like paycheck think would challenge role also start ups think want work environment new place around long time feel like could much different job past little voice head say maybe bad thing trust gut,"woman, job, tech, developer, software",0.7544068856245187,"dismissive, condemn, insinuate, disgrace, rude",0.3833033064430951,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.5166908092801078

About year 10 I started to realize that while I'd been absolutely fine until I entered leadership / seniority roles, trying to lead a man or team of men was hell. Absolute hell. I tried company after company where I was hired in to lead a small team and the entire ( always all male ) team would actively conspire from minute one to not just undermine me but make my life a living hell. A united front of active sabotage. I am not alone. Every research into lady-leavers from tech shows the exact same thing. Once we should be leading, we try... then flee tech in droves.

I have and have had  for a decade now an array of small, ultra-niche software products that I make and sell online. The first couple I attached my actual name too. I'd endlessly get harassing email from men trying to ""help"" that were just berating tirades saying I seem like a ditz, floozy, incompetent moron and that I should let them help. They attached their names, titles and companies to these emails! They actually thought they were helping. Now I use a made-up male name and I literally get emails saying I'm awesome ( which I never got for female-faced products ).

Anyway, that's where I went. I hide. Behind a man's name. I do freelancing under my own name occasionally but even then I have a made up ""boss"" that is a dude. Whenever a client refuses to trust my expertise, I say I'll check with my boss then send an email saying exactly what I said but from my ""boss."" Usually they then email back thanking him and talking shit about me. It sucks. It sucks so hard. but my bills are paid, I get to do the work I enjoy ( the actual work I love ) and facing the endless barrage of misogyny wasn't fucking helping anyone. It just made my life hell.

**Where did you go?**

In case you, somehow, don't know the pipeline problem is a myth. The gender gap in tech roles is because we leave. The pay gap is not on us. Its on the people who decide what to (under-)pay us. Even Google was investigated and found liable by the DOJ for systemically underpaying women.

**Background/Context**

WhitneyRose617 on TikTok shared a [video](https://www.tiktok.com/@whitneyrose617/video/7192286177758596395) of her asking to continue a vendor evaluation with a female sales rep because the sales person she was talking to, shared their screen to reveal their ""Locker Room"" Teams chat about her.

The VP of Sales sent an email to ""apologize"". The [response](https://www.tiktok.com/@whitneyrose617/video/7192398935728688426) was embarrassing. And then the [follow-up phone](https://www.tiktok.com/@whitneyrose617/video/7192696339103534382) call was to save the deal, NOT to apologize and it seems they didn't take the right action internally nor was it done swiftly.

In a follow up video, she revealed that the talk was so disgusting that she didn't want to share because she didn't want her friends & family to know what was said.

Whitney has decided not to share the company name. There's A LOT of respect for the way she has handled this but a number of people have exposed the company in the comments but there is no proof. Until now.

Not only did the employees do an awful thing, but to compound the issue, the company itself is telling its employees to play dumb. To be clear, they haven't fired the employees, just put them into ""training"" while telling staff to deny and lie if asked by outsiders.

It's worth noting at this point that a lot of Cognism employees (of which OP is not one) are incredibly disappointed with the actions of their coworkers and dissatisfied with the response from leadership.

The screenshot was taken from a mandatory all-hands meeting about ""company values"" that took place one day after the incident. Whitney has said that she doesn't want to name the company ""out of mutual respect"" but it doesn't seem like she got/is getting the same respect back.

If they had actually taken the right steps & actions, this post wouldn't be coming out. But clearly, they haven't and people should know who they're dealing with.

Last week, I had a mini melt down after being put on a new project, new timezone, new teammates, and unfamiliar tech stack. My manager encouraged me to pick up some tickets and contribute. I did the easy bug fixes ok but then I got to the meaty dev ticket. I felt overwhelmed again. This is a familiar feeling. It's like brain fog and I crumble under stress. I don't know if I'm cut out for software development since the whole premise is to problem solve and handle ambiguity. I can't do either of those well. I've always battled with anxiety and just constant fear of judgment and critique which gets in the way of communicating, especially asking questions in a timely manner. I've forgotten to eat and shower again, haven't had my period in months (though that might be related to PCOS). This is a negative cycle that is very familiar to me and has been the culprit (I suspect) of not getting return offers from my past tech internships. I get a knot at the pit of my stomach every time I go to stand up because I haven't been productive in days and the team is obviously unhappy with my lack of performance and initiative. Overall, the team has been stressed as well since they have a new release coming but at least they're still being productive. I've been sleeping for 3-4 hours every night just dreading to go to work which is my fault because I can't seem to fall asleep since my brain is thinking of what dumb stuff I will say/do tomorrow. I just can't be productive with this mindset. Sorry for the rant.

Recently I've sought out help for my mental health for the first time in my life and it helps somewhat, got recommended to get tested for adhd and chronic depression. I know I can overcome this, but maybe I need medications to help me because my negative thought patterns are very persistent even after therapy and I just can't find the motivation to physically take care of myself anymore.   


But in the meantime, to pay the bills, I'm thinking of going for a government job for about 6 months until I get my mental health in order. Has anyone done taken a brief career halt to get their mental health in order in order to be their best self? What would I say to future employers about leaving my first job so early?

TLDR: I've been getting stressed out a lot at work and my mental health is in the gutter.

I'm feeling major imposter syndrome. I know it's normal and all SWEs get it but I just have to vent somewhere and just want to hear what you would do?

Context: The startup is really small (20\~ people at this point) and the eng team is probably a team of 5? It will be a fullstack role but for now I will primarily be responsible for the backend (there's only 1 other eng doing this and the rest focus elsewhere). I had originally hoped that my first role would be at a more established company where there's some sort of training program and some mentorship but the reality is those companies have a lot of leetcode style assessments/technical interviews and I just don't do that well on them. I just don't think it's a very fair assessment of your ability to create fullstack apps. That's a whole other point though so I digress.

My biggest fear is that since they are so small (and my team especially), I will have a lot of responsibilities as a founding engineer that could become too overwhelming with someone at my level of experience. With no prior professional experience in engineering, I am really anxious about how it's going to look if I can't figure out how to create features or if I am just not able to keep up in general. Given that they're a startup, I'm sure if I'm not performing to their standards and expectations, I will be let go cause they don't have the runway to keep a useless engineer. I can already tell I'll have to put in a lot of OT and that's honestly fine with me but it seems like weekends aren't necessarily off limits. I get it, it's a startup, all hands on deck especially during a product launch but it scares me a bit. I just have a somewhat fragile mental state where I tend to catastrophisize everything and I worry that this kind of a role will drive me to the brink. I can tell the company is just figuring things out as they go cause the founders are pretty young and inexperienced as well. Pay is very average... if it were better, it  wouldve made the OT less of an issue but at the same time learning is the most valuable thing I can do right now.

On the flip side, there's major room for growth into any kind of role you want in the future and if they do really well and continue to scale, I am on the fast track for management. I also luckily have experience with their tech stack and there's no better way to learn than by doing. The market is also really tough right now and to continue interviewing would feel brutal since I'm not great at leetcode style questions.

I’m white and I have zero good advice. Honestly at this point I’ve just learned to care less about work and more about other shit like my friends, my family, and my hobbies. Being personable and knowing how to make eye contact will go a long way in getting you hired and most of us have an advantage there so I guess there’s that, but once you’re hired good luck with promotions. At this point it’s fine because the money is good and the stress is low but it’s an entirely different beast for those who are more ambitious.

One regret I do have is not being louder. This is hard and extremely more hard because of course you risk the “angry black woman” label. Ew ew ew and more ew. But idk if I had spoken up in more meetings and for example just calmly stated “that is exactly what I just said but worded differently” that would have just been so great and felt so great. You have to cultivate this massive zen and self awareness and ability to not flip a table (v much not my strong suit) and idk if at college age I would have been able to do it. Now I’m pushing thirty and everything is just so much easier as far as that and I still have a long way to go even.

I don’t know where you are geographically but I went to college in Atlanta and I was the only white lady to four or five ladies of color in my classes and there was certainly no shortage of black men so idk maybe Atlanta in general is a better environment for being a minority and in tech. Or, more likely, they found the field insufferable and went and did something different. This is depressing but extremely valid. I’ve heard too many stories along those lines too. But yeah if you’re up for relocation maybe check it out? Cons: a car and traffic forever Pros: black people actually being allowed to succeed at business shit

Thanks!

>Also on the ""familiar with unix based systems"", I didn't know there was an alternative haha. Well, I guess DoD does have RTOS / VxWorks and the occasional Windows-based app <shrug>

O good point - idk why i listed that out. I guess I've just seen a lot of job postings looking for unix and more specifically linux knowledge. And I thought it might be important to list?

>Ok, now to answer the question you're looking for. I think you should interview for mid-level positions if you can. I wouldn't expect it to be easy, but I suspect that if you start interviewing and getting real feedback, you'll find that mid-level is maybe only a few months of focused prepping away.

I'll need to study up on system design too then, right?

>As for industry, if you want to do more DoD roles, go for it, but you're free to try any other sector if you wish. I personally try to avoid defense, gov, and commercial banking, because of the red tape. On the other hand, I know a lot of folks who go into those specifically because of the better work-life balance. If you can spare the effort, I'd suggest you interview at a broad spectrum of industries to get a feel for the different expectations and processes. 

I don't mind submitting a ton of apps. If I plan to do a ton, I can probably streamline things to make it quicker.

I definitely would prefer to not do DoD work anymore. I'd much rather be working in a space that I felt more passionate about (e.g. biotech or pharma though I'm not too picky, ultimately my main thing is I want a stable career with a reasonable work / life balance). It would also be cool to work for a company with a less overwhelming gender split (e.g. I'm the only woman at the company I'm at presently).

>Be a very clear communicator and be very collaborative. There are plenty of smart people, so you're not going to differentiate yourself by that factor. But there are *not* so many people who would make great teammates, so that's a lot more important. You already have the basic tech skills, so that's why I'm suggesting this.

Thank you! I'll keep that in mind. I do think I've got some pretty good teamwork and communication skills!!

Yeah I don't know. My college had a lot of stats majors, but the physics department was/is very small.

In college for my senior project I worked with 3 guys, I came up with our project idea, and this giant idiot says “well you’re the girl so you write the paper and we’ll code it”. A 120 page paper. All me, I wanted the grade and to graduate. Men in damn near every office space will stare or say something appropriate. This is all their problem. Don’t make yourself different for the people around you. The sooner you figure out how to live for yourself and only yourself the easier life will be. The easier it is to see how men behave in school and in the office to talk down on us, think we aren’t smart etc

But also some of the best men I’ve known are in this field also. The good ones will be quiet and hold space to listen to you. They’ll lift you up and help you advance, they’ll shield you from political office bs. 

I also think as we age we have to worry more about paying bills, taxes, and other shit that we are less self conscious. 

I know that’s not instructive, but I hope it helps. And if you have anxiety that is impacting you from living how you want see a doctor, and those you usually have to advocate for yourself to until you find a good doc to be a partner to help you live with less anxiety. I completely understand the bursts of energy. 

If you need more structure, and using a summer camp or boot camp is what it takes to give you that, then right on! For my brain with adhd I benefit from structure but I have to be super into the thing I am learning to be able to focus on it else I’ll end up cleaning the house instead. Luckily I recently started a new job which is fun. I am a technical product owner for a major platform. We’re currently taking old spaghetti code and building a new framework with micro services. 

My background with code and QA go well together. 

One of my first jobs was testing software at AT&T that was used for telecom clients that sold its service - back when the iPhone was exclusive to that carrier. In college I enjoyed data structures and a few other classes that approached different parts of the software development lifecycle and testing was fun. I got to experiment, break things, figure out how a user might unexpectedly use software. I’m naturally curious so this came easy for me

At the time I was really into cosplay and had gone to PAX when league of legends was a new game so my next job I applied to Riot Games and got to work there for a bit

While it was an extraordinary experience, games is underpaid severely and has its own share of controversies. My direct team there was awesome and I learned a lot.

Just a lot of targeted speculation. The reason why she refuses to talk about that is since it entertains the theory that there's a man behind all her work. And being on the defensive about trying to prove your work is your own is pretty exhausting. The CEO of Maker Media even said ""Naomi is a persona, not a real person. She is several or many people."" and eventually apologized but you can see why this is something she doesn't want to deal with. Also, there's also an additional entire cultural context to this situation from how the Chinese government treats women's rights.
 
From her twitter, it shows that she was firm with what she wanted and did not want in an interview. In the VICE article itself, the author wrote ""Wu told me she didn’t want to discuss her marital status, but before publishing the piece, I followed up with her. "" Which is pretty disrespectful since the author intentionally went over boundaries to discuss some conspiracy theories Naomi explicitly didn't want to deal with. 

She intentionally hides a lot of personal information about herself for privacy and safety reasons (she gets harassed and threatened a lot). She also said that VICE included some of her personal information in their media which would make it possible to dox her. This is a huge no-no considering she's in a country that doesn't have the same privileges that many first-world countries do. For example, the #MeToo hashtag is censored by the government and chinese feminists use a ""hidden"" way to express that through emojis. China is a extremely patriarchal country *(see Confucianism)* and a lot of fighting against that sort of culture can get you branded as a traitor to the country for colluding with foreigners. 

That's when the Naomi started calling out VICE on twitter since they were no longer responding to her emails. So I believe Naomi shared someone's address and then Patreon deleted her account for doxing. So now her source of income for creating content is also gone. Other methods of payment for content is generally a no-no since most payment systems require verification of identity. No to both cryptocurrency and legal remedies since she's in China.  As of now it looks like she's gonna stop for a while til things get sorted out. 

I would agree that the article is pretty light I would say but disregarding Naomi's preferences and revealing more personal information than what Naomi is comfortable is the issue. Furthermore, not responding to her communications just exacerbated the situation. It was wrong of her to release someone's address but my personal interpretation is that I think VICE really fucked up here. There is a lot going on and it is really messy given the power and cultural differences.

Ask me anything!",ipt1sbi,,"I can think of lots of ways of making networks simpler and better.  But a good analogy is Englih.  It's a horrible language.  Spelling, pronunciation, ...it's all messed up.  But English pretty much can do the job.  And if it can't, people invent new words.  

Likewise with networks.  People invent ways of incrementally improving things, like with NATs, or CDNs, or network proxies.  So as long as there isn't anything that absolutely can't be done, people aren't terribly motivated to start from a clean slate.

That said, one example of how I'd do things differently is that I'd like packet forwarding be as simple as possible.  Just have your forwarding table give you several possible next hops for that destination, and let the switch/router put it on the shortest queue.  Let layer 4, or higher layers, deal with getting packets out of order or missed packets.  Also, I'd get rid of all variants of L2 forwarding, and just use CLNP and IS-IS.  I'd also get rid of BGP and do another level of link state routing if you need more scalability.

That said...there are horrible issues with the higher layers.  For instance, I was taken in by a scam.  Security on the Internet \*in theory\* is wonderful.  Human types DNS name, website sends certificate.  Wonderful crypto and protocols ensue.  Secure connection results.  But in practice....I needed to renew my driver's license.  I knew it could be done online.  But I don't have DNS names of places I need to visit every 10 years memorized, so I did a web search for ""renew Washington state driver's license"".  I clicked on the top result.  Had I looked inside the URL, the DNS name seemed fine...something like [WA-licen](https://WA-licencing.org)sing.org.  The website was just what I expected, with tabs for ""get a new license"", ""replace lost license"" ""renew license"".  It asked me what I expected (name, address, license number, credit card number, and I thought...success...one chore completed.  I probably would have become suspicious when I never got a license, but the bank fraud department asked me about lots of charges this company was making on my credit card, and I realized the problem and told my bank, which denied the charges and gave me a new card.

But....I claim I did nothing wrong!  How was I, a human, actually supposed to know the DNS name?

A paragraph I wrote in our book ""Network Security"" (3rd edition just came out...sorry for plugging it) is ""Humans are incapable of securely storing high quality cryptographic keys, and they have unacceptable speed and accuracy when performing cryptographic operations.  They are also large, expensive to maintain, and difficult to manage.  It is astonishing that these devices continue to be manufactured and deployed, but they are sufficiently pervasive that we must design our systems around their limitations"".

**First**, I've been in the tech industry for about 10 years.  I'm only just now and only just barely scratching the surface of how many options there are out there that nobody told me about.  I'm in a good place for myself now.  I've been told before that the job I currently have was one I'd never be able to get.  I've been told before that the kind of jobs I wanted don't exist.You're dealing with bad people and liars.  *They* don't want you in the industry.  But as I was telling some webdev bootcamp students last week:  *You belong here.*  Doesn't matter how many liars have told you otherwise, they're wrong and there's a place for you to do what you want.  (Especially in your case with how misogynist and generally shitty your boss is.)

**Second**: BURN THE BRIDGE.  That piece of shit is counting on your lack of experience to hold you in place.  He's counting on your lack of experience to make the ""bad reference"" sound worse than it is.  I can tell you from direct personal experience that some bridges need to be burned.  My two favorite quotes on the subject:  ""You are more likely to be changed by a bad environment than you are to change it.  So leave.""  and ""Did you burn a bridge, or did you clear a path?""

**Third**:  Degrees and formal education are not as mandatory as everyone is telling you.  There are *a lot* of jobs that don't care how you learned how to do something, only that you did learn it, or that you are able to learn it.  I personally have no formal training.  My partner's a web developer and they have a 2D-animation degree plus one of those web boot camp certificates.  (Don't knock a good boot camp - I know several developers who I wouldn't be able to tell you if they went to boot camp or traditional schooling paths)

Your self-confidence is your strength.  That power you have to say *No* to your asshole boss is the power you should call on to take the plunge and get out of there.  It's not necessarily going to be easy to find or move to another job without direct training in it, and the job search itself always sucks, but good jobs are out there and you are worth more than your employer is putting you through.

(PS - you may be dealing with some 'imposter syndrome' at least partially from how abusive this job is.  I've not been in exactly the same position you're in now, but I think it may be good to seek out local 'Women in Tech' meetups, or other niche tech meetups that aren't just white bearded dudes complaining about the beer selection.  It's good to have people you know face-to-face who know what you're going through.)

Edit: About the 'bad reference' thing:  I have had a *nasty* falling-out with an employer, up to the point of legal threats.  It has never come up again in any way.  Even with the very next job I got, it was not a problem.

How should I talk to her?,12akfid,,"TLDR,coworker only sees me as a pixel pusher on a big project I brought her into. Won’t adhere to her role and is constantly overstepping and disregarding me. 

I am a black woman in the UX design space. My coworker (white female) is not in design but is a part of our marketing team. One of my big assignments for the year is redesigning on of our internal sites (it was absolutely built in like 2012…hideous.) and because it’s a big task, I was able to build a small team — including a consultant for vendors, the mentioned marketing coworker, & another UX designer. I swore I had a dream team. I’ve worked with these people before closely and have had no issues. 

Last week we got on a call with a developer vendor who asked on the call if we wanted them to handle all aspects of the site rebuild (ux, design, development, etc). And we have been clear that we only need them to do the development…

Why….did said coworker tell them that in her personal opinion, she thinks they should handle it all? Because “it’s more complex than just building a flyer” ??? I know I felt that as a jab and my other designer did as well. That pretty much showed me that she only sees us as graphic designers…when that’s far from what we do. 

She then goes on to tell them that she wants them to build a custom platform that has a specific feature we’re using a different vendor for and have already began working with. (& their work is fantastic. It’s not like they’ve dropped a ball or anything.)

Both the consultant and I corrected her. And it was a bit embarrassing to not appear on the same page when we’ve had several meetings about everyone’s role on the project and the roadmap for the project. It seems she only pays attention when she is waiting for someone to stop talking so she can interject. 

she messaged me after to apologize for not realizing that we’re doing the UX & design in house. But this is what bothers me—we’ve been on several intro calls together about this project. Each call, I break down my role and mention that I’m handling the UX and design along with my consultant and my other UX Designer. 

It felt like a slap in the face, because not only did she disregard the whole team on the call, but she also wouldn’t let anyone else get a word in. (The call was supposed to be a DEMO FROM THE VENDOR. She wouldn’t stop rambling and even give vendors a chance to demo!)

After the call she reached out to apologize but then ask if she could see my designs that I have so far. This was extremely annoying in itself, given that we’ve started only started the ux process but two weeks ago. And the last thing we need to be concerned about is the design at this very moment. 

Once I told her that, she mentioned her apology again. I barely acknowledged it at the time because I was upset, but now that I’ve processed, I’m still really upset about it. 

How should I talk to her about the situation so that she clearly understands her role within this project, and the need to stay in her lane?",3059,testimonial injustice,tldr coworker see pixel pusher big project bring adhere role constantly overstep disregard black woman ux design space coworker white female design part marketing team one big assignment year redesign internal site absolutely build like 2012 hideous big task able build small team include consultant vendor mention marketing coworker another ux designer swore dream team work people closely issue last week get call developer vendor ask call want handle aspect site rebuild ux design development etc clear need development say coworker tell personal opinion think handle complex building flyer know felt jab designer well pretty much show see us graphic designer far go tell want build custom platform specific feature use different vendor already begin work work fantastic like drop ball anything consultant correct bit embarrass appear page several meeting everyone role project roadmap project seem pays attention wait someone stop talk interject message apologize realize ux design house bother several intro call together project call break role mention handle ux design along consultant ux designer felt like slap face disregard whole team call also let anyone else get word call suppose demo vendor stop ramble even give vendor chance demo call reach apologize ask could see design far extremely annoy give start started ux process two week ago last thing need concern design moment tell mention apology barely acknowledge time upset process still really upset talk situation clearly understands role within project need stay lane,"work, job, leave, code, rude",0.7689164610514073,"inexperienced, bitterness, belittling, dismissing, ostracism",0.04,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.3731635276806038

I work on a small team. On MY projects, it’s me and one other guy. New guy (NG) came to the project five months after me, and two months of that, I’d been running it solo. We both report directly to the PM, who used to be a dev many moons ago, so he knows a little but not a lot; he also runs several other small teams.

So NG basically comes in and every project follows a pattern: I say, “Here’s what I’ve done on it. It’s not finished. It was worse when I got here. Here’s the plan I architected to fix this long-term and here’s the temporary fix it put in place, which is still better than it used to be. We wanted to wait for you to get here before we started implementing the new plans to get your feedback. What do you think?”

And he takes it over. And in a lot of cases, I’m happy to give it to him because I’m swamped with my own higher-priority stuff. But he implements the plan I designed, usually with NO changes, and then he starts bugging me constantly about, like, trying to teach ME how to use the new system that I designed. Or randomly and without warning trying to voice call me on Teams to ask me if my work is sync’ed to the new GitHub that I designed (isn’t the entire PURPOSE of our GH so we don’t have to HAVE these conversations?). 

He’s so nice and friendly and helpful. And there certainly are times when I need and value his input, and I have learned a lot from him. But…

There’s also those Friday nights where the PM decided to push to Prod for some ridiculous reason, so the three of us start a Teams call at 4:30 that goes until 3 am to try to find the problem. And inevitably, around 5, I say, “Hey, why don’t we try <insert super easy fix>?” And NG and the PM instead say, “No, I’m pretty sure it’s <something that makes no logical sense>. Let me pull in <random person from other team> and we can get on with tech support (who winds up staying in with us so long they go through a shift change).” Everyone else on the call is ALWAYS a guy, of course, and I might mention my idea a few more times, only to get shut down, so I just sit back, set my laptop to the side and basically let it turn into background noise unless I’m called on. And then, around 1:00, somebody says, “You know, what if we tried <my idea, but said like it’s the first time it’s been mentioned>?” And everyone acts like it’s the first time they heard it, and they try it and it works.

And again - everyone is super nice and helpful. And I legitimately AM less experienced, so I know I still have a lot to learn. But …

I expressed my frustration to my husband, thinking that it had to do with me being less experienced, and he said, “They’re not discounting your ideas because you’re new. They’re discounting your ideas because you don’t have a penis.”

My college hooked me up with this interview, believe it or not.  It was the weirdest interview I've ever had.  It was with this small local IT business - there was a web page, but pretty old - I think it was last updated in 2014 or 2015 if memory serves.  But, it looked plausible.  And, I'm going to community college, so these types of jobs are probably as good as it gets at first.  The email said they were looking for an intern/junior developer resource to assist with a client project.  That they'd designed a custom web-based solution for a customer using PHP and MySQL and they thought it would be a great hands-on opportunity that could lead to additional opportunities.

Anyway, we met at a local coffee shop.  Over the course of the interview, there were a bunch of holes in the story and the story shifted.  It became a plugin they needed help working on.  Then it was a plugin the customer had purchased and customized and needed help.  Oh, and by the way, it was injected with malicious code or something?  I'm not really sure at this point what it was.  (Later, through research, I discovered it could be a malicious plugin that infects wordpress sites?  This is judging by the name that was stated of the plugin, anyway.  Though, all of this could be fiction.)

Then, he made a comment about how difficult this PHP is, especially without a debugger...  (It was stated as if he thought it's not possible to have one when working with PHP??  That is not true.)  And, something else he said made me think he didn't know how to set up his development environment or didn't bother.  He seemed amazed I have XAMPP installed and configured, which was just weird.  Why would he even be talking to me if he would be amazed by that.  He even had me spell it.  Ugh.

This wasn't sounding like the job opportunity stated in the email.  And it was all just...  off.

So, I googled the guy's name and turns out he's a sex offender.  I discovered old news stories about how he'd been charged with many counts of kidnapping and rape a little more than a decade ago. I also found him on the sex offender registry. He was convicted and released in 2011. It's definitely him.

Anyway...  My question...  Ladies, what's your opinion about having your picture on your developer portfolio page?

I am beginning to think the entire reason I ended up having a breakfast ""interview"" with this guy is because he saw my picture.  It was a head shot of me on my bike, with my bike helmet on and sunglasses.  It was just the theme I put together using a couple photos from when I was out on the local bike trail during the summer.

I got COVID, felt kinda foggy minded for a while, got very work anxious because of not being able to focus well and tried to compensate for this by working over time a lot. I pretty much burned out and ended up also making some stupid mistakes (not anything huge but the mistakes ended up costing me time)

Despite loads of overtime, I still failed to deliver my project on time and what was originally estimated  (not by me though, I originally estimated it as min 4 weeks) as a 2 weeks project ended up taking 7 weeks. 

My manager (45M) complained of this, told me I wasn't transparent enough with my delays and that my velocity is not up to the standards and that he will have to take action unless I improve. I wasn't officially put on PIP though and my latest review before latest 1.5 months was good (3 months ago). 

I don't have any real arguments against his complaints, I'm not sure what to tell him since it is technically true, I didn't announce the moment every single unexpected tiny unexpected thing popped up, I just said during dailies ""this will take longer than estimated because of x"", but I didn't give an exact date of when it will be done. Rest of my team (3 M)   doesn't do this either when delays happen, but the vibe coming from my manager is ""no one had this big of a delay"". 

To cut the story short, I decided to quit, I feel really bad because of the mistakes I made and I don't know if there's a way to get the respect of my team back and I hate that even the most junior person I have extensively mentored is now treating me as a noob because of the delayed project. I also just dread work lately and can't seem to find my way back to this job being enjoyable. The reason why I'm postponing quitting is that I have some equity which should be vested in 1 month. 

The rational part of me is telling me to just stay for one more month but I feel like this will just erode my confidence more and make me less confident for upcoming interviews ( I also don't desperately need the money). I'm really in kind of a bad headspace now and don't know how to act at work anymore . My manager and I are discussing actionable plans on how to make sure transparency is embedded in every one of my projects, but my heart is not in it anymore and all conversations feel blaming (maybe I'm overly sensitive? IDK anymore)

 I just can't bring myself to give a fuck and I also can't help coming back to the feeling that I'm maybe not cut out for this field. During my 7 years as an engineer, 90% of the times, I've been in teams where I was always the only woman and I always felt out of place. I'm not saying this is the reason why my performance is bad but it takes a toll on you to always be the odd one out and I'm just tired of feeling like this all the time. The only time when I really thrieved was this golden 9 months period when I had a female manager, who was also an awesome engineer. 

 Sorry for whining. What would you do in my place, power through for one more month?

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:31,2023-05-10 18:45,Instigated-,Comment,Hiring manager said I would be a good option for diversity reasons.,jjnzrzp,,"It would be worth asking what they mean by that.

There is a difference between wanting diversity as a tick box, and valuing diversity because it is a value add.

I absolutely believe we need more diversity in tech spaces, and standard hiring practices tend to benefit men - so, to counteract the bias towards men and improve diversity we have to make some conscious effort towards hiring more diverse candidates. 

This doesn’t mean hiring someone just because they are a woman etc, rather it’s about valuing what else they might bring, and challenging our biases that might otherwise devalue the candidate.

For example, I got really annoyed when our company was talking about unofficial selection criteria for a new grad program. The recruiters had advertised it to be quite inclusive and we were swamped with applicants, so internal discussion in the engineering dept started to be about looking for a unicorn - wanted someone with a CS degree AND a medical degree (or similar). 

80% of CS grads are men, so when that is made a requirement you are statistically more likely to end up hiring a man. Add in the extra criteria to also have a second degree in medicine… I’m pretty sure it would narrow diversity further. Who has the privilege to delay entry to the workforce by doing 2 full degrees, when both those degrees provide good employment opportunities?

This new unofficial criteria is bs. There is no evidence that someone who has done two degrees in different fields is going to be a better software engineer or a better employee. However by creating narrow criteria like that, we end up ruling out a lot of diverse candidates who have other things to offer that could be more relevant to the role.

I am fairly new to this field after reskilling from a previous career (a bit over 1YOE), and what is becoming obvious is that a lot of men I currently work with lack emotional maturity and insight, behaviour skills, and this impacts on the decisions made and how the team works. They are more technically skilled than I am, however I am a better team player than a lot of them and bring something beyond tech skills. We know that statistically speaking from a young age girls/women develop this at a faster rate than boys/men.  

Men don’t necessarily know what they are lacking, so when they are designing the interview/recruitment process they may not evaluate this in candidates… and unconsciously prefer to hire more people like themselves that are also lacking in this area. (Not “all men”, just on average).

Those who do recognise this gap in our workplaces quite rightly understand that women on average tend to have more EQ and stronger behavioural skills that would benefit the team. And that diversity in all its forms adds value, as people with different life experiences bring new knowledge and insights into our teams, rather than people making decisions from an ignorant bubble.

In such a case, it is not a bad thing to want to improve diversity, and consider it a value add when hiring a diverse candidate.

If we don’t make a conscious effort to improve diversity, then we end up with what we already have had for decades - an industry that unconsciously biases towards men.",3223,testimonial injustice,would worth ask mean difference want diversity tick box value diversity value add absolutely believe need diversity tech space standard hiring practice tend benefit men counteract bias towards men improve diversity make conscious effort towards hire diverse candidate mean hire someone woman etc rather value else might bring challenge bias might otherwise devalue candidate example get really annoy company talk unofficial selection criterion new grad program recruiter advertise quite inclusive swamp applicant internal discussion engineering dept start look unicorn want someone c degree medical degree similar 80 c grad men make requirement statistically likely end hire man add extra criterion also second degree medicine pretty sure would narrow diversity privilege delay entry workforce 2 full degree degree provide good employment opportunity new unofficial criterion bs evidence someone do two degree different field go good software engineer good employee however create narrow criterion like end ruling lot diverse candidate thing offer could relevant role fairly new field reskilling previous career bit 1yoe become obvious lot men currently work lack emotional maturity insight behaviour skill impact decision make team work technically skilled however good team player lot bring something beyond tech skill know statistically speak young age girl woman develop fast rate boy men men necessarily know lack design interview recruitment process may evaluate candidate unconsciously prefer hire people like also lack area men average recognise gap workplaces quite rightly understand woman average tend eq strong behavioural skill would benefit team diversity form add value people different life experience bring new knowledge insight team rather people make decision ignorant bubble case bad thing want improve diversity consider value add hire diverse candidate make conscious effort improve diversity end already decades industry unconsciously bias towards men,"work, job, leave, code, rude",0.7644594662647215,"devalue, infantilizing, dominant, rejection, bested",0.5199999999999998,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.7546688613435449
girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:04,2023-09-09 9:13,SeveralSpiderPlants,Comment,"""Women in IT"" groups",jzt73c7,,"I tend to agree. Been a woman in tech for 25+ years now in companies from 80 to 30K employees, and in bigger companies there's definitely a reluctance to be friendly with women (in the same way a man would be friendly with another man) in case it's misconstrued or they accidentally say the wrong thing. If somebody accidentally makes a smutty pun (which I find hilarious myself and regularly make them with friends outside of work) there's this sudden awkwardness and I often feel obliged to reassure everyone in a light-hearted way that I'm not going to go running to HR (or I make a worse one myself which really confuses them!!). 

For a man, it's basically just going to be easier and more straightforward to be friends with another man in fear of accidentally saying the wrong thing - never mind if the actual woman in question doesn't actually care, they can't ever be certain of that. 

We all know that promotions at a more senior level are based on who you know and relationships, and less your performance or impact, especially when resources are tight. For the last decade I am sick and tired of hearing about how outstanding my performance is, how I'm due promotion, but there's a queue ahead of me waiting to be promoted. Every cycle this always turns out to be either those with a solid friendship with management, or ones who are able to make a lot of noise in meetings (green flag for promotion unless you're always wrong) because they have a network of friends who have their back so they appear more competent and are more confident. When I speak up, it's a lot harder to get that wider support, which not only makes me appear less competent but makes me less willing to speak up too. And that's even disregarding unconscious biases which heap on top - just the nature of having more workplace friends makes a huge difference to prospects on its own, never mind the unconscious sexism going on. 

On the plus side in recent years even if I appear to have fewer workplace friends, I also have fewer clearly quite creepy approaches too, but that could just be because I'm getting older now and feel more comfortable mentioning my husband and children :D 

Thankfully at most places I usually do have a few male friends who know better - usually these men are happily married and pretty much always have daughters, which says it all really. The few that aren't married who have been (non-creepy) friendly are always very sociable, chatty people generally and quite unusual in this line of work! Or the reverse is true - men who are oblivious to social expectations and haven't twigged I'm ""dangerous"".

In answer to the OP - never worked anywhere with a decent women's group, or when I have, I've been excluded. Current place driving me crazy as it's global with US HQ, they do loads of ""women"" things in North America and Asia, but I'm in EMEA and they ignore us.

Until very recently I was the only woman on a sales team of 28 men, working in cybersecurity industry which is already an extremely male-dominated industry (only 20% women overall).

My first month out of training I became the top global performer — to be honest I think I was overqualified for the position to begin with, but still ended up with the lowest possible base salary 😒” 
I’ve been consistently minimized, dismissed, alienated from “the boys club” (term used all the time, with the whole team consistently addressed as men, boys, fellas, gentlemen… when I’m literally right there and very much a part of the team), had my feminine voice mocked, and received *multiple* comments about how my success is basically due to “IT nerds just being excited to talk to a woman.” I’ve beenJust the tip of the iceberg 🤪
I’ve been misled — every time I exceed the expectation or timelines my bosses set for promotions/raises, they move the bar, despite having better numbers, more experience, and additional contributions to the team like training new hires (which of course is not compensated even though it takes time away from my quota…. And yet I still outperform lol…?).

I’ve then been lied to and gaslit (and I don’t mean that in a hyperbolic way) about a lot of these conversations. I started recording my conversations with management because I felt like I was going crazy being consistently told that’s not what they said (they did lol). Full disclosure it’s illegal to record someone without their knowledge in my state so obviously can’t actually use it as evidence. Any discussion on how to improve communication on constantly changing expectations, I’m being told I’m pushy or to stop “bitching and moaning” (direct quote from my manager 🤪). But I have started leaving a paper trail, but even with that my managers still deny it?


Despite this happening for months, I didn’t want to make any waves and be seen as causing problems, and just convinced myself it would get better eventually (especially when I’m constantly told I’m about to receive a promotion or a raise which is promptly walked back once I exceed that expectation).

Despite my managers blatantly discouraging me from involving HR (like at least I have them a heads up?), I finally a conversation with HR last week and they said some comments I mentioned definitely constitute harassment and they felt concerns about discrimination were valid (their words, not mine), so that felt validating. They’re investigating, but after HR reached out to my managers, my managers approached me and have already begun spinning the conversations or denying it (again, I literally have the recordings so I know I’m not misinterpreting in hindsight).

As of last week I’m VERY actively applying to new jobs, most with internal references and my numbers and experience are stellar (not to brag, just again for more context literally 200-333% of quota month over month), but feel like I’m like an inch away from suggesting legal action if I’m not out within a month.

girlsgonewired,new,2023-10-24 20:01,2023-04-30 9:45,confused_xyah,Comment,CS degree?,jiayvaq,,"Well, here's my experience from a graduated SWE! I initially did not intend to enter the tech world but I was a very maths/physics enthusiast. A family member of mine recommended CS for me since it is very high in demand and it aligns with my interests. So I did it, I got accepted and my journey began. 

I'll tell you this from my experience, its not an easy field but it definitely is enjoyable and worth it if you like it and at least have some interest in it. In college, they'll give you the basics, the foundations and its up to YOU to expand more on your knowledge and to learn concepts on your own. There's definitely aloottt of searching and learning on your own. As for the maths, you'll need to be decent at it ofc, but since you mentioned that you have frontend in mind, I wouldn't worry too much about it. 

Tips/advice I'd give if you're set on pursuing CS:

1. Start early. As in start coding and developing projects to build up your skills. Start off slow and put what you learn into good use. It doesn't have to be anything major. But just code.

2. Practice practice practice! I can't empathize this enough. You'll not be good if you just understand the concepts and do one project/ assignment and that's it. You have to try and tinker with them. Maybe search up a different way to do a certain task or maybe you want to add another feature that came to mind. That way you'll fall in love more and more in programming and have faith in yourself that you could DO IT!

3. Google. Omg I always say that to be a good swe you have to be a good googler. Alot of my classmates struggled with that and I was honestly surprised that alot of people can't correctly search/ lookup what they need. Simple things such as debugging, looking up errors and basic things you'd find in docs! So yeah, Google is your best friend if you learn how to truly utilize it.

3. Establish a good connection with your professors and classmates. You could learn and save sooo much time and trial and error if you seek advice from your profs. They hold so much knowledge and you'd be surprised that alot of them love to help out and appreciate students reaching out. Or at least the good profs. you'll have the rude ones, those you need to avoid at all costs lol. As for classmates, sometimes you just need a friend to explain a topic to you that you can't understand from a teacher at all. Idk what it is, but I think its because we mostly think similarly and our thought process aligns. 

Lastly, but thats more of a heads up and to reference what I mentioned at the start, learning does not stop after you graduate and ESPECIALLY in tech. You'll always have to learn, look things up, build fun side projects. So due to that, you may sometimes feel like you're lacking behind or you're not understanding things quickly enough or God forbid, the imposter syndrome. But its all part of the process and I'd like to think of it as a rising cycle. You struggle, you learn, you get good and then you repeat the same thing for another technology/ language or whatever it is lol. 

Those few tips are what stood out to me from my journey and would love to give to myself as advice if I had to start over. I wish you all the best with everything and feel free to contact me and ask me about anything you'd like 😊

He's incredibly micromanaging, to the point I'm embarassed and feel very uncomfortable about the fact I've been doing things (including conversational things, like asking for help, or asking if others would work alongside me) on his requests (/orders) as if it's my own words and doing.
I believe others have picked up on me overly asking for reassurance and others input too, due to me being terrified to risk making any mistake - no matter how menial or small - and this has been very embarrassing at times also. And I feel it's affecting my character and reputation. I'm really not happy about this.

I really started to see things clearly as I've been doing way better recently, connecting with others on the team a lot more (where I was very withdrawn before) and being pretty confident and bubbly, getting work done, contributing much more in meetings, etc. And guess what's happened? He's got way worse. Criticism after criticism. Had a meeting where everything I said almost was responded to with something negative. It was unreal and really just very abnormal. He also questioned if I am capable of working when I am experiencing health symptoms (I have a disability, and I am capable of working at those times, decently so as well), made out I was being way too slow, and was clearly undermining my decision to work full time hours.

I'm good at my job, I'm really capable. I got really high up for my age when I was still very young. Previous manager called me ""one of the best engineers on the team"" - I was a 23 year old girl. Funnily enough, my first interaction with this guy, years ago, he undermined a suggestion I gave and it turned out I was right, also.

He invalidates what I say, my opinions don't matter or are actively rebuffed. He treats me with absolute distrust, and only seems to trust I'm not stalling on work and taking time for valid technical reasons when I'm working with another developer (interestingly, male developers thus far).

I'm starting to genuinely think he's threatened by me - which would sound way too big headed for me, but after reading about why people bully at work, and seeing the pattern of it worsening the better I'm doing, I'm starting to conclude that might be true.

Most of the advice I see online is to just leave. It's not worth the stress and health effects, etc.

I like this company and don't particularly want to be bullied out.

Also, as a women in tech, I'm tired. I'm so tired. It's not 1 company, it's a repeating theme. I've not had this level of targeted harassment before, but there have been plenty of other problems. I'm just so tired of it all. Is the solution really just to keep upping and leaving, every time the men start to treat you too shit? (Not to make it overly gendered, it just so happens most of this career is male so, not sure how much is gendered or if it's just people in general).

Open to any and all advice and experience.

This guy is a nightmare and it's making work really tough. I want to enjoy my job again. I want to be good at my job again without feeling this horrible stress hanging over me. I don't feel like I work for a company anymore, I feel like he just wants to control me via himself, down to way too many fcking details.

I’m going to give you some advice that I wish I could take, however am not good at taking! (Yes I am a hypocrite: everything is easier in theory than in practice).

Put things into a little perspective: why is it that we think women have embarrassed themselves when they lose their temper after being target of a sustained attack of degrading hostile behaviour, yet men are never embarrassed to have degraded women in the first place? If there are two wrongs here, defensive behaviour is not the worst of it! Totally different scale.

Be kinder to yourself and know there is nothing you could have done to succeed in that last job. If it took you losing your shit to realise it, then I’m glad you lost your shit, so you can move onto greener pastures.

Reflect on the experience to identify the red flags that you initially ignored… what is the point at which you should have left, rather than staying as it got worse? Make a note that will remind you of this line, maybe put it on a post-it on your wall, and as you go into future jobs, if that line is crossed take it as a marker to leave.

I wouldn’t assume that this new job will be misogynistic just because you are the only woman on the team - my best team was with some great guys and i was sole woman… later was so happy to join a team with another woman dev, however she has turned out to be the one who is most likely to treat me like crap… it’s unpredictable: hopefully your new team will be great people regardless of gender.

When joining a new team, take a beat to observe how it is working, what the dynamics are, mostly listen at first. You might have some awesome skills/knowledge to bring to the team, however they may not be ready for it, and it can backfire if a new person turns up and starts changing the dynamics.

Some mental tricks to handle if it is rocky (for whatever reason): know it is them, not you. Not within your control or responsibility to fix them and their shit. Focus efforts on what you can control. Take care of yourself & attempt good work/life balance and stress management. Act with reciprocity: give your time and effort to those who do the same to you, while those who are crap at responding to you can be met in kind with equal lack of response. Document evidence of mistreatment, partly for your own sanity (you are not crazy, this is real), and partly for if you ever want to make a complaint or need to defend yourself. 

Differentiate between those who are actively treating you badly and those who just don’t notice or speak up (when being treated badly, it can feel like everyone is in on it, however it may just be one or two). It can be an alienating experience, and will be less stressful if you make some friends/allies.

I’d also say that the more you care, the more it hurts. Sometimes you have to decide not to let it hurt you too much, find the things you want out of the situation, let the other stuff go.

However that is all said with the caveat of knowing that “line” that shouldn’t be crossed. It’s not your job to be a doormat to people treating you badly, and only you know where that line is for you.

I really don’t understand, with all the education and “civilisation” people have today, why are workplaces often so shitty? Wish human kind was better than this.

xxstem,hot,2023-10-24 23:49,2022-10-04 11:39,anti-pSTAT3,Comment,Strategies to deal with Men in Teamwork.,ir10xmn,,"To be upfront, I’m a man. But I do know a bit about some strategies for dealing with this, and I have dealt with similar bullshit, though probably less regularly. As you say, the thing here is not gender (of course), but insecurity. In your case that comes from sexism, but there’s plenty of insecurity out there to drive this behavior - trauma-based insecurities, and those rooted in racism, homophobia, transphobia, et cetera. 

What works for me:

1.	Find an ally and confide in them. Tell them what’s going on and ask for their help. 
2.	Tell your ally the best way to help is to ‘echo’. If you have an idea that you propose, they should, immediately after you speak, say “I really like Alexandria_CA01’s idea to do X.”
3.	Reciprocate wrt #2.
4.	When a credit is stolen, use your ally to take it back. They might say “I’m really glad you like the idea Alexandria_CS01 proposed, Chad; I do too.”
5.	Reciprocate. 
6.	Attribute ideas to your insecure male colleagues fairly (I.e., if it’s genuinely theirs). 
7.	if you get pushback, the fragile egos can be a tool for you to use. An ally who has become concerned about pushback might say “It seems to me it takes some real insight to see the brilliance/nuance in Alexandria_CS01’s idea. Thank you for helping to highlight that for us all, Chad.”

Your ally need only be interested in fair attribution. Their identity does not matter for this to work. 

If you can’t find and use a good ally, you have a harder road. You’ll have to do the attribution work yourself. For that, you want to inoculate, attribute, and get into feelings. 

Inoculate: At the beginning of a project, note that “WhIlE iM nOt CoNcErNeD aBoUt AnYoNe HeRe, I’ve noticed lately a culture of people taking credit for other peoples ideas and I could really use your help.” Note that it happens to everyone (even though that is false). “Can we try to build one another up and explicitly attribute ideas to the person who says them first?” Make them ‘white knights’ and praise the shit out of them *only* for appropriate attribution. If they take ideas from each other, call that out immediately. Your goal here is to get them to see it, and if possible, to believe it happens to them too. You also want them to believe it flies under the radar and, if possible, that “we are all guilty of this sometimes, and it’s not intentional, but still needs to stop.”

Attribute: as above, attribute correctly. 

Feelings: when you have to confront directly, use ‘I feel’ statements. “I feel undervalued when you claim credit for my ideas.” But also, lessen the blow in all but the most egregious cases e.g., “I don’t think that was intentional, and I think you just want what’s best for our work, but it still needs to stop. If it happened to you I would 100% have your back, and I need you to have mine now.”

Lastly, we need to manipulate their feelings some more. It’s worth noting often and loudly that the surest sign of a good leader (or of someone worthy of promotion, et cetera) is their ability to recognize and promote talent in others. Thank them when they do right by you and note that their positive behaviors make you think highly of them. 

In the absence of an ally, you have to create them, often from shitty people like Chad. But Chad is an insecure little boy who needs praise and you can use that to build a better workplace.

womenintech,hot,2023-10-24 20:21,2022-07-28 14:46,redpoppy29,Comment,Have you ever reported sexual harassment at work?,ii0x4ik,,"I didn't report sexual harassment, but I did have to report someone for a hostile work environment. He was an equal-opportunity asshole who was outright abusive to everyone he encountered. I work in an industry where yelling and cursing is very normal, but this dude went above and beyond and would even get physical sometimes. One day his focus landed on me, and though there was no sexual/gender element to his abuse, it was behavior that needed to be reported.

It turns out dozens of people had reported this guy, but I was the first woman to do so. Even though I made no mention of sexual harassment or gender discrimination in my report (because there wasn't, if anything this crazy dude held back a bit since I'm a women. At least he didn't  physically push me the way he did some men), but since a woman made the report, all the lawsuit alarm bells went off. There was an investigation where all the other reports that had been swept under the rug were brought to light, and many other employees were interviewed. The company's fear of a sexual harassment lawsuit finally forced them to deal with this asshole.

I was amazed by the positive outcome! The hostile guy was put on leave and sent to anger management courses, and he totally cleaned up his act. When he returned to work there was no more shouting, cursing, slamming, throwing, or pushing. His face would turn beet red and you could see his jaw clenching and veins throbbing in his forehead, but he controlled his behavior. I would have never believed it possible that a person of his age and position would put in the effort to change, but he did.

Also the HR director for the division was fired, most likely for failing to take action on all the previous reports. 

There are so many stories about women experiencing retaliation for making harassment reports. I completely expected this to happen to me based on the overall toxic work environment at the company, but nothing bad happened. I made the report, got called in a week later for a brief interview with HR people from outside the division, and that was it.

Granted the guy I reported was a cartoonish rage monster, which is not the norm for harassers, who are often much more subtle. I just wanted to share my surprisingly positive reporting story. Being a woman actually helped in this situation, and I am proud that I used my powers for good. 

My experience in general, though, is that women are not believed when they report a problem. There has to be a lot of documented behavior for corrective action to ever happen. If you report the behavior, even if nothing is done to help you, you are laying the groundwork to help another woman when she inevitably encounters the same problems, or his behavior gets worse because there were no consequences for his original transgressions. 

That being said, as much as I am all about women supporting women, you have to do a risk assessment of your particular situation. What is the worst possible outcome? Though the behavior you are describing is relatively minor (for now), retaliation can be very outsized compared to the report. Depending on your position in the company, how long you have worked there, how well established/respected you are, what your supervisor/boss is like, you may or may not be able to withstand the retaliation. Even if you can deal with it professionally, how will you do emotionally?

He uses our 1 to 1 for status updates,  if there's a bug from code written by me, he makes me explain to him the whole code flow leading to it and afterwards concludes with stuff such as 'this is something very basic you had missed"". He does not even know the codebase, how could he know is ""basic""? He blames all delays on a project I had on me (even though there were factors outside my control such as product requirements changes, testing delays from qa team which I pointed at and reestimated). 

He second guesses my estimations and pushes me to always go lower. He even got another colleague to double check my estimations and ""convince"" me some project can be done faster.  As far as I can tell I'm the only one from my team he does this with ( rest of the team is male).

This culminated with him giving me a very poor performance review in which he compared me with another colleague and blamed me for negatively affecting my team's reputation. I should say here that he's a new boss in our company (4 months), I had good reviews from my previous (female) boss and generally got good reviews from other peers. I truly feel like he somehow got it in his head I'm a shitty programmer and wants me out of the team.

I'm not a ""live and let live person"". I felt his review was unjust, told him so, tried to make my case on why I'm not this awful lazy employee he was making me out to be, we had a pretty heated discussion in which I did not feel heard at all. Only thing he offered to do was erase the name of the colleague he compared me with from the review.  I guess he could tell how shitty it was he put such a comparison in a professional review. I said ""nope, imo, this review reflects more of you than it does of me"". 

After this, I knew i could not stay in the team any longer, i went to my skip boss and told him the whole story (with citations from what my boss told me) . I also told him I plan to either switch teams or change companies. 

He agreed, was pretty understanding and offered to help me move teams as they would rather keep me. Right now, I'm in the process of doing just that, but I haven't decided on a team yet. 

Today I made the mistake of deciding to tell my boss I'm leaving the team,  just so he would get the hint and cancel all of our 1 to 1s until I leave the team and just replace them with written status updates. He was pretty surprised and kept asking me why I'm leaving, that he did not mean for this to happen ( while having a smug smile on his face) and he hoped we could discuss on how I can improve myself to fit his criteria . I kinda went full bitch mode and told him all the ways in which he was a shitty boss for me (no screaming or anything like that, just stating all the ways in which I felt wronged and how I'm leaving because of that). He ofc disagreed and suggested again I should fess up and take responsibility for any project issues, since I was the feature lead and that in his eyes, despite my experience, I'm close to junior level . I'm working towards senior promotion so I guess that was somehow meant to be hurtful. 

Now I feel pretty bad and I'm questioning if I should stay with the company, I'm also not sure if criticing your boss that much is very professional and I'm afraid I'll be labeled as a bitch in the next team I go.

I have SUCH a hard time finding accommodations. I posted a while back about being sexually harassed, not given accommodations, teased for my disability, etc. I wish I could say the lack of accommodations is uncommon.

I got a new job in a different lab, and I'm struggling. I am the only lab member other than the PI. This means that I have to do all of the tech work for the entire lab, and my own project. Because of my disabilities, I struggle to do so much. I have tried talking to my PI, but I feel like she says the right things in the moment because she feels she has to, but doesn't practice them. This isn't intended to be a PI-bashing thread, as she's very nice. But, like every other PI in existence that doesn't have a disability, I think she just doesn't understand. And it doesn't help that the ""publish or perish"" mentality isn't conducive to some of the time issues I have. This isn't her fault-this is a product of abysmal funding rates. But she'll offer things, and then not follow through. She'll offer to help with the genotyping, and then hand me a ton of racks, and experiments to do. It's tough. And she's easily set off, which is ok, she's stressed. But I sometimes have to guess what she wants, and it's a little hard. And some people are just like that, and it's nothing personal, but I sure wish I could get it right. She'll tell me I can tell her if it's too much, and then not respond if I do. She offered to take an undergrad though work-study to help me, and then later decided not to. I have electronic pipettes I can't even open (they're an accommodation for the cerebral palsy) because I just do not have time to learn how to use them. I have to read literature (cell biology and intestinal stem cells are totally new to me, at least experimentally). And she's getting really frustrated, and I feel so bad. She's a new PI, and it's just the two of us, so I think she's under a lot of stress, and I'm not what she wanted. I feel like she said the right things, but didn't know what she was getting herself into, which is understandable.

At this juncture, I'm beginning to understand that I am never going to find a lab that is able to support me, because my disabilities require the one thing researchers can't sacrifice-time. And it's hard. And I feel so, so guilty when I come in every day and I forget little things like where I put the stockroom card or whatever, because my hair is just on fire (people with non-verbal learning disorders also have trouble with organization, and parts of my recall are impaired). And naturally, it frustrates her. I just want to be what she needs, but have realized I can't fit into STEM.

I'm heartbroken because this has cost ten years of my life. I've been through a lot. Sexual assault, abuse. A ton for my degrees and to get here. I'm hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and juggling an online MS, and test prep in addition to this. I can't sleep. I'm horribly depressed. I contemplate suicide multiple times a day. I don't know anyone here. I'm alone and I feel like this will never get better, and like there's no way out.

I've tried telling my PI I need a little help, job-wise, but I think she's lost faith in me and wants me gone. I'm job hunting, but the job market is scary for people with disabilities, legal or not, I've never found anyone willing to provide accommodations. And I know someday, probably soon, I will face homelessness. And I don't want to live through so much struggle anymore.

It sounds like you need someone on your side that understands you. You sound like a very considerate person - everything you say is followed by explanations for why your PI acts like she does and that you understand her, yet you don't get any understanding back. That's very nice of you, and at the same time very unbalanced and probably taxing for you. No wonder you're feeling down - this is a shitty situation and you've done everything right. It's not your fault your PI didn't follow through on her promises. I don't blame you for feeling hopeless. 

From personal experience though, I can say that there definitely ARE labs that are good at accommodating people with various disabilities. They may be hard to find, or you may have to move to work there (I'm in Sweden, for example), but you're definitely not doomed if you want to continue in research. I myself have had struggles due to a suspected autism diagnosis, but thanks to a good therapist and an understanding PI I've been able to adjust both schedule, work flow and the workspace so that it works for me. I am currently working with a person newly diagnosed with ADHD who got a lot of help from the University to figure out how to structure their work in order to reach their goals as well, and I work with a professor with dwarfism who has been here for decades. My other PI (yeah, I have two) I even suspect has autism themselves. No one comments on any of these things, except maybe to ask if you need help if they think you may be struggling and you're a new student.


I'm mentioning this only to say that there are places that would welcome you and help you out, and that your experience so far isn't proof that you're not a good researcher. Your PI sounds inexperienced and overwhelmed, and it was unfortunate that you ended up with her when she obviously can't cope with the situation she's found herself in. You deserve more. I think that you may need some outside support so that you get an idea of what to tell her when asking for accommodations. Maybe you need a therapist/occupational therapist, or some other type of mentor who could help you go through all the things you need so that you can just turn up with a finished list of things and how to do them. That way she wouldn't have to spend time trying to figure out how to fulfill your needs, and instead just do exactly what you ask. It would probably also help you to be able to raise all of your questions and needs in a neutral environment before having to go to her, if you think she may be judging you for the things you tell her. 

When I was having a hard time, the thing that helped me the most was finding a therapist with whom I could go through all of my struggles and find practical solutions that could work in my situation. I needed confirmation both that my struggles were real, that they were worth taking seriously (for me AND for others), exactly what I needed to change in order for me to work effectively, and practical tips on how to ask for accommodations when the people around me didn't know what I was struggling with. I understand the frustrating disconnect between needing accommodation to be productive, and seeming needy or like a burden for asking, even though you're actually being less productive when you can't get the help you need. That's why I think presenting her with the solutions to your problems in a prepared form could be good - it seems more like you're being proactive.  


This got long, but my message is, in essence :


1. See if you can find someone to discuss your struggles with that is not your PI. Find out exactly what you need, if possible, and see if presenting a finished list of your own solutions works better than discussing your struggles with her directly.

2. If you think you need to change labs in the future, there are good labs out there. Your experiences so far doesn't mean there's no place for you in science, or just means it's harder to find the right place for you and you've had bad luck.



Lastly, if you do decide that you don't want to continue in science, there is no shame in that. It's completely understandable because it is a competitive field, and maybe you decide that the sacrifices you'd have to make to make it work are too big. Just don't blame yourself for it. You deserve to be somewhere where you can be comfortable, and your requirements are not unrealistic.

Since then, I was promoted and have been taking on a crapload of responsibilities as a mid-level (lots of task management and prioritizing since I don't have a direct report who does UI), I think I produce decent quality work, my code is clean, i follow standards, i strive to make better choices systems-design wise every time i'm presented with those opportunities. 

Overall, i've never gotten negative feedback, despite begging for it. But -- i've also very rarely gotten anything positive. The pressure of the project we're on is starting to really push down on us, and I'm the dedicated ui engineer on the project that has so many complex UIs. I'm honestly super tired and I'm reaching points of feeling like i'm just dishing things out without actually becoming a better programmer. Morale on the project is low due to high attrition, design flip-flopping, timelines, etc. I have decided that I need to leave, and all my friends (ex-workers from this company) are rooting for me to break out of this gig. I updated my resume and have been studying for the dreaded technical interviews...

Honestly I'm petrified. I feel like my problem solving skills have utterly deteriorated. I can hardly look at a leetcode easy without staring at the prompt dumbfounded for 15 minutes before giving up. I am freaking terrible at abstract concepts, even going as far as to say I have no idea how I work with OOP every day and make things work. I get stressed out quickly and my problem solving is just so so so SLOW. On top of it, despite having an associates in Math, I am actually complete crap at it. It's been years since i had to do real math, but honestly it's starting to affect my job in subtle ways, like i'll tell designers the thing they want done will take too much time for me (which my producer is latching onto because he knows how tight the deadlines are) and it's causing my designers to send me subtle signals that they believe I'm incompetent.   


I spent a few days studying up on the typical things like Big O, data structures, dynamic memory. Everything is cool and I am feeling really confident about things conceptually. But as an actual program solver...I am just no where near hirable right now. I don't even feel like an engineer. I'm so scared that even if I did pass an interview my imposter syndrome would swallow me whole and I would not be able to do anything. I don't want to pigeonhole myself into one framework or niche. I want to be a more well rounded SWE. 

I have an enormous drive to do better and I love what I do. I have no problem making myself study, i believe I'm a super hard worker. But problem solving as a skill has left my body and I don't know how to get it back. I'm sorry this has been so unbelievably long and scattered, i could use advice at all...or if anyone could relate and have a similar story of fearing their skills aren't transferrable.

girlsgonewired,new,2023-10-24 19:59,2023-06-06 18:40,Instigated-,Comment,Can anyone learn coding if they apply themselves?,jn6k017,,"Not exactly “anyone”… the world is a very diverse place, and just like any profession (teacher, lawyer, physiotherapist, sportsperson, train driver), some people will have the potential and others not. For example, people who faint at the sight of blood would struggle to be a surgeon, people who don’t like kids would make terrible child care workers, and people who have a very low IQ, severe learning disability or illiteracy may not be able to do professions that require a high level of literacy and cognitive function…

Having said that, there is no such thing as being “naturally inclined” to tech… no one comes out of the womb with coding skills… everyone has to learn it. People who are good at it have learned and practiced this skill to become good at it.  And that means, if we learn and practice it we can develop the skill too.

If you want to learn it, are willing to put in the time & effort to do so, and have the resources to (computer, internet, etc), then there is a good chance you will be successful in learning it. You don’t need to have had tech related hobbies or interests or a maths/science education. You future is not determined by the past.

I reskilled from a more humanities/creative/arts background. I did find that learning to code was a very different type of learning to most of the learning I had done before in educational and professional contexts - it required a high level of commitment and effort (couldn’t coast). It reminded me of when my daughter was learning to read - first she had to learn to recognise the letters, then the sounds those letters made, trying to read was very frustrating and slow, sounding words out letter or diphthong bit by bit and the inconsistencies in the English language, lots of mistakes, at first trying to read was a nightmare and she felt terrible at it and it felt useless because her skill level was so much less than what she wanted to be able to do, what she could see we could do - there were times she would throw the book across the room in frustration or there would be tears…. And then after about 9months of concerted effort, there was a point it “clicked” and she knew enough to read simple texts by herself, and was able to build on that, and suddenly she was away & able to be a self learner learning more words, reading harder books, reading independently.

When you start learning to program you will feel useless for quite a long time. There are a lot of basic fundamentals you have to learn, that are hard despite being “basic”, lots of terminology and jargon, before you can do anything useful. You will feel stupid, even though you aren’t, because there is such a gap between your ambition and your current skills. Hang in there and don’t give up. 

Before I really dove into learning to code I did a free online course on coursera “learning how to learn” developed by neuropsychologists, which draws on scientific research on techniques that help you learn more effectively- including cultivating a growth mindset. I found this really useful, on those days when coding and feeling stuck, knowing that even if I couldn’t solve a problem today, the attempt to solve it was helping build & strengthen the neural pathways in my brain that would help me get better at it in the future.

I also was really clear on my motivation - why I was learning it - and reminded myself of this regularly, so that it was something I felt I needed to do, that I couldn’t give up even if I found it hard. 

The other thing is to just get started, and see how you go with introductory stuff. Codecademy has some free courses and an interactive platform that I find really good for beginners as a starting place.

Overall I really do enjoy working with my team. Over time we've developed and established healthy norms and boundaries of how we work (ie. not interrupting others when they are presenting/speaking, using the raise hand feature on zoom calls, giving space for others to speak up, calling each other out if we are taking over the meeting, you know just being a civil human being), we are all remote so establishing these things and holding each other accountable I think is really beneficial.

Recently our scrum master , who usually does a great job at moderating our meetings to keep them on track and productive, was on PTO for two weeks and it really showed in our meetings. The meetings were, in my opinion, unproductive and chaotic. There is another person at the company who is stakeholder in my teams work who joins the calls every now and then and kicks any civility out the door, we'll call them ***Stakeholder A***. The meetings all ended up just being arguing about things and I tried to step in and keep things moving but just got talked over and ignored. By then end there weren't even any action items or takeaways. I was really disappointed in how the meetings went down and posted a message in our team chat reminding the team of our working agreement, giving space for others etc. I didn't specifically call anyone out, just as a team lets do better next time. The ones on my team who felt guilty enough were actually accountable, recognized their behavior and apologized. Keep in mind I literally said no names since it was multiple people and my message was just a reminder and I also recognized that it's something I have also been guilty of before as well.

And then there was ***Stakeholder A*** who messaged me privately saying how they felt like I was calling them out and they would setup recurring 1:1 with me. Cool. I then apologized for making them feel that way and they said they didn't care about me making them that way and wanted to make sure we had a healthy and productive relationship. Double cool! I said 'absolutely! and it's also important across the entire team to have a healthy productive environment, because when people leave jobs are they leaving the job or a toxic environment'...am I right?.

Then it started to go downhill...they told me I shouldn't throw around the phrase ""toxic environment"" just because I'm not getting my way....which confused me...I wasn't trying to ""get my way"" other than being civil and respectful in meetings. So I stated that I never said there was a toxic environment within our team but that I do believe certain behaviors can lead to it. In which ***Stakeholder A*** responded that they didn't want cabals forming?....which confused me even more. This particular ***Stakeholder A***, in the past has also accused me of being sensitive when I asked them about roadmap they were creating (not even exaggerating...all I literally said ""What roadmap are you referring to?"") and that I would likely never become a penetration tester (I'm still relatively new in my Application Security career \~6 years now and my imposter syndrome is very real).

What could I have done better in this situation and how can continue to deal with this going forward. I've tried to let these things slide with this person but this recent interaction is really bothering me. I'm really trying to work on my soft skills and leadership skills and take it heart to improve upon so would love to hear other's thoughts/opinions/constructive criticism/feedback.

womenintech,hot,2023-10-24 20:13,2023-09-23 18:11,dr_run,Post,Should I stay or should I go?,16qgtof,,"Hello! Looking for advice on whether or not I should jump ship from my current job and join another company.

Company A (current employer)

Pros: cool technology, technical work is interesting and fun. I work hybrid which I actually don't mind (my commute is super low effort and it's nice to see faces in person once in a while...plus, snacks and a few fun social events here and there make it a nice change of scene from my home office). I'm learning a lot and feeling like a stronger developer and data scientist.

Cons: The team culture is not great and I've had an extremely roller-coaster like experience. Some days my manager and I are extremely in-sync and I feel appreciated and valued; other days, he snaps and says something extremely rude and tone deaf and I feel extremely undervalued and under appreciated. While my manager clearly means well and says all the right things (ie that he supports women in tech and wants to build an inclusive and collaborative team), in practice he's sort of like absent dad who is very stressed out and can't manage the bad apples on the team. He works many long hours and doesn't seem to be enjoying managing. The team dynamic sucks; communication between team members is poor, and I was paired with someone on my team when I started who turned out to be an extremely insecure sexist bro dude who is your classic ""difficult to work with"" programmer. Me and this dude almost immediately started having problems. My own manager even privately said to me that he thinks this guy has ""issues with women."" Things got so bad between me and this coworker that I was forced to do a mediation with him (which I resented the whole time as I didn't feel I did anything wrong, a fact that my own manager said to me in private and a fact that is corroborated by the fact that I have positive relationships with literally everyone else at the company). I have since stopped working as closely with this coworker and have shifted my focus to working with people on another software team who are much more collaborative and as a result, am learning new things and am getting the opportunity to have more impact.

&#x200B;

Company B (new potential employer, currently interviewing): 

Pros: I was referred to this company by an ex-coworker from another company who I had a very positive experience working with. She is currently working there and has nothing but good things to say about the team and culture. The hiring manager seems extremely empathetic and positive, and we had a great first interview. It's clear I'm a great fit for this role, that I would enjoy the work, and that there are many opportunities to learn and grow. They are working on building an AI platform (read: very hot right now) and the tech would be super fun. He seems very intentional about wanting to create a good collaborative environment and is aware of the difficulties women face in this line of work.

Cons: It's a new job and I feel a bit gun shy/risk averse. Like many people in tech, the last 2-3 years have been *very* topsy turvy for me career-wise and I'm craving some stability. In 2021 I was part of a large RIF and got laid off. Then I joined a company about 6 months later that I wasn't super gung ho on for the paycheck and immediately regretted it, and jumped ship after 6 months to land at my current job. Now, a. year later, as I'm contemplating jumping ship again, I'm worried how it's going to look on my resume. Plus, what if I'm being sold a bill of goods at Company B that isn't real? What if the team and culture at this new place really aren't as good as ex-coworker and the hiring manager says they are? FWIW I do trust her and she does not sugar coat things; she is a straight shooter and I don't believe she'd knowingly misrepresent.

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:21,2021-04-02 15:38,JordanLeDoux,Post,How to stand out as a programmer,mirtl2,,"I was thinking today about some of the things that I've learned through my own experience. I've worked as a programmer/software engineer, but I've also had positions as a software architect, senior engineer, and high level engineering management.

One of the things I was realizing is that it's *very* easy for me to answer the question ""who stood out to you as a programmer that you managed?"" And I realized that this is information that isn't shared as frequently as things like tips on how to work in python, or how to set up a great dev environment, or so on.

So here's two things that made programmers I managed stand out, and one that made me stand out.

First is making mistakes once. I had a programmer that I managed earlier in my career that was very green. She had JUST gotten out of college (I was literally the first manager she had as a programmer), and she made a LOT of mistakes that came from lack of experience actually doing the job... but to this day she's one of the best programmers I've ever managed. The reason is that when she made some kind of mistake, she investigated *why* she did it and *why* it was a mistake until she understood it, and then she didn't make that mistake again.

I cannot tell you how eager I was to spend my own time making sure she succeeded, because I *knew* that any time I invested into helping her get better wouldn't be wasted. Any time I spent helping her multiplied my time, because it increased the number of people on the team who could do that thing by one.

I think she was able to do this because she put a lot of effort into having her own process for doing things. Having checklists she went through, making notes that she referenced, and documenting not just the code she wrote, but her job itself. Not for me, but for her. She was an amazing programmer and she had zero experience.

Second is a guy on my team who simply moved to the next step. When he had a bug or a problem to solve, or a solution he needed to implement, he'd finish a step, check if it worked, and if it didn't work he immediately went to the next thing on the list to try and further debug the problem. He was much better at this than I am, or than most other programmers I've worked with, and honestly it's such a simple skill if you can keep the discipline. A lot of programmers, myself included, will look at an unexpected output or unexpected program state, and get mentally stuck on the thought ""but it *shouldn't* ever be like that"".

Right. But it is. It's right in front of you, it's literally what's happening. I'm terrible about this actually, it's probably the largest way I genuinely waste time as a programmer. If I encounter a problem that makes me think ""but it shouldn't be possible for it to get into this state"", I get mentally stuck. It makes me worry that I fundamentally misunderstand what's happening, or that I somehow broke something that is extremely basic, and I spend too much time trying verify all my basic assumptions.

In reality, it's pretty rare that you *accidentally* break some kind of foundational aspect of a program, especially when you're not making changes in a core file or core library or something like that. Most programmers I've worked with or that have worked for me have that same kind of mentality to varying degrees, but this guy would just start immediately debugging so that he could find the issue. He wouldn't spend time on verifying his assumptions about the architecture or program as a whole unless the debugging led him in that direction. Basically, he maintained focus extremely well.

The thing that I feel really helped me stand out, and that I received a lot of feedback on over my career, was that I was able to always keep in mind the user perspective. When I was given a feature to implement, I would actually think about how a user might use it, why it would be useful to them, and what sort of problems it would solve for them. I'd think about what sort of experience it would enable for them, and why that might be a thing they appreciated.

This would help me do things like suggest improvements that made managers notice me, or simplify the task into something we could do faster by understanding what the actual *goal* was instead of just what the *task* was.

So what are some things that have made you stand out as a programmer? Or that have made other programmers stand out to you?",4393,testimonial injustice,think today thing learn experience work programmer software engineer also position software architect senior engineer high level engineering management one thing realize easy answer question stand programmer manage realize information share frequently thing like tip work python set great dev environment two thing make programmer manage stand one make stand first make mistake programmer manage early career green get college literally first manager programmer make lot mistake come lack experience actually job day one best programmer ever manage reason make kind mistake investigate mistake understood make mistake tell eager spend time making sure succeed knew time invest help get good wasted time spend help multiplied time increase number people team could thing one think able put lot effort process thing checklist go make note reference document code write job amaze programmer zero experience second guy team simply move next step bug problem solve solution need implement finish step check work work immediately go next thing list try debug problem much good programmer work honestly simple skill keep discipline lot programmer include look unexpected output unexpected program state get mentally stuck think ever like right right front literally happen terrible actually probably large way genuinely waste time programmer encounter problem make think possible get state get mentally stuck make worry fundamentally misunderstand happen somehow break something extremely basic spend much time try verify basic assumption reality pretty rare accidentally break kind foundational aspect program especially make change core file core library something like programmer work worked kind mentality vary degree guy would start immediately debug could find issue spend time verify assumption architecture program whole unless debug lead direction basically maintain focus extremely well thing feel really help stand receive lot feedback career able always keep mind user perspective give feature implement would actually think user might use would useful sort problem would solve think sort experience would enable might thing appreciate would help thing like suggest improvement make manager notice simplify task something could faster understand actual goal instead task thing make stand programmer make programmer stand,"advice, tech, need, work, feel",0.6523399714660363,"discipline, demeaning, erasing, charged, torment",0.5199999999999998,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.6182475830135366

# My suggestions for learning JavaScript

1. **Practice Regularly**: Code or learn new concepts every day. Start with Vanilla JavaScript before moving on to frameworks like React.
2. **Master the Basics**: Understand the fundamentals of JavaScript thoroughly.- 📒 Interactive book: A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript. The new tech-assisted approach that requires half the effort ([https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-JavaScript-tech-assisted-approach-requires/dp/1497408180?tag=hackr-20&geniuslink=true](https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-JavaScript-tech-assisted-approach-requires/dp/1497408180?tag=hackr-20&geniuslink=true) ). 📒 Free courses in Frontend Masters: [https://frontendmasters.com/courses/#free](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/#free)
3. **Leverage AI**: Utilize AI tools like ChatGPT ([https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) ) for coding inquiries. It allows you to paste your code snippets and ask for help when you encounter bugs or need clarification on concepts like ""What is a function in JavaScript?"". While it's a powerful tool, remember to verify the answers and ensure you fully comprehend the explanations provided.
4. **Set Up Your Environment**: Learn to use an IDE like VSCode for coding.
5. **Invest in GitHub Copilot**: Github CoPilot will help you with writing code, but always read and understand what the code it completes does, and confirm it does the same thing you wanted. If you don't understand the code Copilot completes, then copy that snippet to ChatGPT and ask it what it does. It's a pretty neat and fast way to learn content that is relevant to what you are building.
6. **Refer to MDN** (Mozilla Developer Network, [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)): It is a resource for developers, by developers, provided by Mozilla. It contains documentation, tutorials, and guides on web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. It's widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive, reliable resources for web development information.
7. **Find a mentor**: Seek a coding mentor who can clearly explain concepts and empathize with beginners. Their experience can help you navigate through coding challenges and enhance your understanding of complex ideas.
8. **Pair program**: Pair up with someone to code. It's a great way to learn from each other.
9. **Replicate projects**: Engage with YouTube tutorials where small programs are built. After watching, recreate the program independently, resisting the urge to refer back. However, remember the video is there as a safety net to help you if you get stuck.- Here are good programs to write and to try to find videos on YouTube: ✅ **To-Do List**: This is a classic beginner project. It will help you understand how to manipulate the DOM, handle user input, and manage state in JavaScript.  ✅ **Weather App**: This project involves fetching data from a weather API and displaying it. You'll learn how to work with APIs, handle asynchronous operations, and manipulate JSON data.  ✅**Quiz App**: Create a quiz app with a set of questions and multiple-choice answers. This project will help you understand how to work with arrays and objects, handle events, and update the DOM based on user input. ✅**Calculator**: A simple calculator app will help you understand how to handle user input, perform operations on data, and update the DOM. ✅**Note-Taking App**: This project involves creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes. You'll learn how to work with forms, handle events, and store data in the browser.
10. **Consider paid courses**: Consider high-quality paid courses like those on Frontend Masters. They also have great Python courses (📒 Practical Guide to Python: [https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-python/](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-python/)).📒Vanilla JS: You Might Not Need a Framework ([https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vanilla-js-apps/](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vanilla-js-apps/) )
11. **Take care of your health**: Remember to take breaks, exercise, and be patient with your learning process. Coding can be challenging, but it's rewarding in the end.

xxstem,hot,2023-10-24 23:51,2020-10-22 15:18,supershinythings,Comment,Men don’t respect me in group settings?,g9ofijm,,"Guess what?  'Bitches' get stuff done.

They're going to call you a 'bitch' whether you like it or not.  They probably do already behind your back.  Because you don't want to be a 'bitch', you are now a doormat.

So find your inner 'bitch'.  You can deliver messages in a deadpan and make your views known.  Sure they won't like it - you're not being a doormat anymore!  If you're not a doormat, you must be a 'bitch'!

They will treat you the way you demand to be treated.

I had a coworker that kept calling me 'honey'.  So each time he called me 'honey', I called him, ""My Sweet Baboo"", ""KissyFace"", ""My Babycakes Sweettart"", etc.  The other guys picked up on the game and suddenly everyone was making up their own fun little names to address him by.

He stopped calling me ""honey"".  In that case, I found a funny way around the issue. But another way would be to say, ""I'm not your honey, Mr. SoAndSo.""  I use the name ""Mr."" to accent the formal environment, as opposed to the informal behavior.

Telling you to pick up their trash - that's just pure DOORMAT.  ""Hey guys, I'm NOT YOUR MAID.  Were you raised by WOLVES?  Clean up after yourselves.  Oh you can't find the trash can?  IT'S OVER THERE.""  Sure now you're a 'bitch', but guess what.  'Bitches' get respect.  They don't like having to respect a woman so now you're a 'bitch'.  

Every woman with power gets called a 'bitch'. Any woman that sets boundaries and enforces them gets called a 'bitch'.  You don't get to choose how they want to denigrate your gender.  If they're going to do it, there's not much you can do.  At least ONE of you can be happy (you) .  This is just how it is when dealing with dinosaurs and those who come from cultures where women are marginalized.  A woman with a voice and her own power will always be called a 'bitch'.  

You don't get to be 'nice' and also respected if they're treating you like a doormat, taking advantage of your need to be liked.  Since they don't respect you anyway, you may as well set your limits and be whatever it is they're going to label you as anyway.  As long as you are PROFESSIONAL they can call you a 'bitch' all they want.  There's nothing to take to HR.  

If they complain, point out that they are punishing the very same behavior they themselves exhibit and admire in men.  Would they EVER ask a guy to clean up their messes?  NO.  Why you then?  WTF are you getting paid to do?  Clean up other people's messes?  Because that makes you the highest paid janitor EVER.  Your manager (assuming s/he is not present) will want to know if they're wasting your time and disrespecting you like that.  It's WRONG and a really great demonstration of sex discrimination - something that would look GREAT in a lawsuit.

Stay professional, set your limits and boundaries, and when they cross them, ENFORCE THEM.  Document document document each time you encounter this behavior - keep your own notes - times, dates, locations, names of others in the room.  If this ever goes to HR or to an attorney, those notes will be invaluable.

I too have had to have a male repeat what I said word for word to get my words accepted.  And they thanked HIM.  Now I lower my voice to pretend to be a guy - pointing out that they're tuning out my female voice - and letting them know that this is NOT OK.  It's funny but it's not.  I actually had a guy come over, ask me a question, didn't like my answer, went to my team lead, asked the exact same question, and the team lead said, ""Didn't you hear what SuperShinyThings said?  She's the expert.  And BTW, she's right.""  He was shopping for another answer and wouldn't take my word for it.  In that case, my team lead had my back.  

In many cases this isn't the case.  So after someone did this to me a few times, I just won't answer.  I'll say, ""Why ask me?  You never believe me anyway.  Why don't you just try it out and see for yourself?  Me answering won't give you the answer you want, and you're just going to go ask that guy or that guy, who will give you the SAME answer.  So don't ask me any more questions because now all you're doing is waste MY time as well as their time.""  This was very in-his-face, and might be construed as 'bitch', but I was calling him out on his behavior.  If he wants to complain, we can all talk about why he shops around for an answer he likes and never believes what I say even though he asks me anyway.

Unfortunately this shit is pervasive, and in some cultures built-in.  When those cultures interact with more female-friendly environments, they bring their prejudices with them and they have to be corrected somehow.

If the environment is just too hostile, it may be necessary to find a different place to work.  Make some complaints first, note that they are ignored, then you've given them notice that this is an issue; now your conscience is clear if you seek other employment.  Be sure to let your employer know that this is why you're leaving.

womenintech,hot,2023-10-24 20:18,2022-12-01 12:07,[deleted],Comment,is this normal or does my job just suck?,iyieb88,,"From my POV after \~2yrs so far in tech from startup internships to post-grad jobs (tho have YoEs in other work, long comment ahead from a fast typer, editing for brevity, TL;DR at end):

**First half #s**:

* **1** relatively normal depending on how intense a job is (drained by EOD). The self-esteem part may be a personal thing. Try a system of drafting applications on weekends but actually sending on Monday or aim to do only 2 weekdays after work like Mon-Tues.
* **2** depending on how young or inexperienced, 2 can be relatively normal. Imposter syndrome is common, maybe try ""fake it till you make it"". But can be a personal thing since you've now noted low self-confidence & self-esteem. Personally frame this diff. so what you think you lack doesn't prevent you from trying/applying (i.e. less focus on what you don’t have today and more focus on what you can gain in the future and do have today). Apply anyways because XYZ such as you want to learn and like doing the best work possible. Nothing will change unless you try and no one has everything. Plus the more you accomplish the more your self-esteem & self-confidence can improve.
* **3** it's good to be self-aware. Many ppl for better or for worse may be situational procrastinators or ppl pleasers, so while there's room for improvement, it's relatively not uncommon. As far as being avoidant, depends on how you frame & label. I've seen avoidant ppl, but they call themselves shy introverts. Room for improvement but my take now is that you're very harsh and critical towards yourself for being human, maybe relating to your low self-esteem & self-confidence?
* **4** yep all jobs can ebb and flow in when there's good to less ideal parts of them, normal :) no job will be perfect or great 24/7
* **5** room for improvement since humans are social by nature so think if you had a support network, you wouldn't have as low of self-esteem or self-confidence. Isolation & loneliness can lead to anxiety, sad thoughts, lethargic (maybe relates to you not having energy after work to apply to jobs EOD?), etc. Good news: very easy fix. Make some friends and I bet you that parts 1-4 will improve.
* **6** good to be self-aware...but also no one is perfect nor had a perfect upbringing. Even friends who grew up in rich happy families w/ everything handed to them in life have aspects to their childhood yrs or themselves that are not ideal. Imo it's a part of being human. Also some of the most successful ppl in the world (history to present day) had bumpy upbringings or came from very disadvantaged backgrounds. This doesn't define you or your abilities to be a good employee or X imo. What may be less relatively normal here, is thinking that it's all your fault. Seems to tie back into low self-esteem, low self-confidence, & no social support network (isolation & loneliness).

**Second half #s**:

* **1** lacking support in work but are expected to support others would be draining or stressful for most. Your lack of social support network outside of work hrs then amplifies it. Everything you're experiencing doesn't surprise me it sounds like an unfortunate predictable cycle of experience.
* **2** if you rarely connect to those higher up, but you think they can help w/ guidance or assistance, plz take initiative in reaching out professionally. No need to work in isolation & be there for everyone while no one is there for you. Would be hard for anyone to do for yrs or X time, normal human reaction to a tough scenario. There may be personal ""quirks"" that may have prevented you from taking steps that can alleviate it, but fixes & solutions exist.
* **3** you have high expectations placed on you, a spotlight, yet you weren't set up to succeed the best. Unrealistic or near impossible standards to operate in w/o adequate support sounds pretty hard. Like being set up to fail or constantly disappoint. Plz try to realign their expectations, communicate professionally to the right ppl, if possible.
* **4** work boundaries are very important. Set them for yourself and communicate/ enforce them. This is something many encounter (not just you) and juggle since it's a balancing act in the workplace constantly (depending on coworkers). However this just sounds more like being overextended w/ more demands on you w/o support. Maybe they have no clue if you've never communicated it or show discomfort or stress.
* **5** ya this sounds difficult to navigate. If you can professionally push back &enforce workplace boundaries, that hopefully will stop. Or communicate to them that if it's assigned to your team, that XYZ are current priorities, so it'll be in the backlog to eventually get to.

**TL;DR**: now that I've said the above, others have also already weighed in with pretty good advice. Perhaps seek outside professional counsel for some personal ""quirks"" that may be underlying (i.e. low self-esteem, low self-confidence, & no social support network) but there’s things you can do to improve those solo too. A new job where some of these settings/structure/scenarios aren't there may help. There may be things you could do in current workplace that can help, tho will be tricky in achieving w/o rocking any boats.

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:40,2019-10-25 18:10,womenintecheastcoast,Post,Women in Tech East Coast 2019 conference review: mediocre at best.,dn4opy,,"I just got back from the Women in Tech East Coast 2019 conference, and I wanted to share what it was like.


*The Organization of the Event*


* There was no signage or people around the building to help direct you to where in the convention center the conference actually was; no room numbers given to go to, just a side of the building (West). I've never been to the convention center before (it's HUGE), and I got lost. I also talked to a number of other people at the conference, and every person I talked to was lost at first.


* If you bought a certain tier of ticket, you are asked to register ahead of time for certain sessions, but during the conference it was not clear where registered vs unregistered people go. They needed signs or line separators. It was literally a huge group of people standing around, until somebody working there actually walked around and told us what to do.


* Trash on tables between sessions, so you couldn't tell if seats are “taken” by coffees or if it’s just trash left behind. Like it wasn't a ton of trash, but there was at least one or two coffee cups left on each table when we went into new sessions, and you can't tell if that's a person trying to save a seat or if it's just garbage, but it turned out to just be garbage the majority of the time.


* Somehow they didn't have enough printed stuff for certain sessions. You know how many people will be in the session, and even if you let in extra people, print out extra sheets to be prepared.


* The food was very tasty IMO, but I'm pretty sure that you have to get food through the convention center or through a food company they may contract out to.


* The food the first day of the conference had nothing for vegetarians other than a caesar salad. The second day they had two dishes for vegetarians other than salad.


* They did record the sessions, and they were also insistent on people speaking into the microphones so they would be heard on the recordings and so that people who are hard of hearing could hear everything.


* The staff members were very nice.

* Today they didn't serve lunch until 2 p.m., which to me seemed pretty late, but that's a smaller detail for sure in the grand scheme of things.

* The wifi actually worked well, which usually doesn't happen at a conference.

* Lunch was included when you bought your ticket, which is cool.



*The Content*


* The conference wasn't really a women in Tech conference as much as it was a women in technical management conference. The majority of the talks focused on things like: how to run a team, the future of agile, why we need diversity and how a lack of diversity affect us, how to build trusting teams, and how to lead. Even the few that happened we're just at an incredibly high level, like very simplified, and they were about pretty broad & popular topics like AI and ML, nothing really new or experimental or anything actually technical. The content of the presentations was great if you are in technical management or are a woman in a tech company in a non engineering position, but if you are an engineer, don't expect to learn any hard skills at this conference. For a women in **tech** conference, this conference was incredibly non-technical.


* Some of the speakers were VERY good. Please note that I'm not knocking the speakers themselves as a whole. My last bullet was specifically about the content over all of the conference, and the spread, or lack thereof, of different topics.


* Two of the keynote presentations weren't really relevant or presenting about anything that was useful. I remember sitting there thinking, why is this person giving **this** presentation right now, and why is it a **keynote**?

* Three other keynote speakers were very inspiring and had very relevant presentations.


* There were a number of presentations explaining why diversity is important and how diversity can bring good things for your company and product, but at a certain point it's like, if I'm at a women in Tech conference I'm not likely the person that needs to be convinced that we need more women in tech (and there's only so much I can do about this issue in my company), and I especially don't need five different presentations on that same topic at the same conference. I know that sounds really goofy to say because I do want more women in tech, but I'm not the one that needs convincing, so the same topic over and over was repetitive and not super helpful.


*To sum up:*


If you are a woman in an engineering position and have ever gone to the Grace Hopper conference, absolutely don't bother going to this unless someone (work or school) pays for it all.

If you are a woman in tech who is not in an engineering job, this conference has useful information, but a number of the topics are things that have been presented about a lot before, so if you've ever gone to another women in tech type conference, this one will be a bit repetitive.


If you can't go to the Grace Hopper conference for whatever reason, this is okay to go to if your job or school pays for it because it's better than nothing, but I wouldn't say this is worth flying to or paying for yourself. If it's not a short commute to the conference, don't bother.",5238,testimonial injustice,get back woman tech east coast 2019 conference want share like organization event signage people around build help direct convention center conference actually room number give go side building west never convention center huge get lose also talked number people conference every person talk lose first buy certain tier ticket ask register ahead time certain session conference clear register v unregistered people go need sign line separator literally huge group people stand around somebody work actually walk around tell us trash table session tell seat take coffee trash leave behind like ton trash least one two coffee cup leave table go new session tell person try save seat garbage turn garbage majority time somehow enough print stuff certain session know many people session even let extra people print extra sheet prepare food tasty imo pretty sure get food convention center food company may contract food first day conference nothing vegetarian caesar salad second day two dish vegetarian salad record session also insistent people speak microphone would hear recording people hard hearing could hear everything staff member nice today serve lunch 2 p seem pretty late small detail sure grand scheme thing wifi actually work well usually happen conference lunch include bought ticket cool content conference really woman tech conference much woman technical management conference majority talk focus thing like run team future agile need diversity lack diversity affect us build trust team lead even happen incredibly high level like simplify pretty broad popular topic like ai ml nothing really new experimental anything actually technical content presentation great technical management woman tech company non engineering position engineer expect learn hard skill conference woman tech conference conference incredibly non technical speaker good please note knock speaker whole last bullet specifically content conference spread lack thereof different topic two keynote presentation really relevant present anything useful remember sit think person give presentation right keynote three keynote speaker inspire relevant presentation number presentation explain diversity important diversity bring good thing company product certain point like woman tech conference likely person need convince need woman tech much issue company especially need five different presentation topic conference know sound really goofy say want woman tech one need convince topic repetitive super helpful sum woman engineering position ever go grace hopper conference absolutely bother go unless someone work school pay woman tech engineering job conference useful information number topic thing present lot ever go another woman tech type conference one bit repetitive go grace hopper conference whatever reason okay go job school pay good nothing say worth fly pay short commute conference bother,"woman, job, tech, developer, software",0.7868680396315192,"inexperienced, bitterness, belittling, dismissing, ostracism",0.04,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.7031255592848693
womenintech,top,2023-10-24 20:23,2022-11-25 8:15,Impressive-Kale-9661,Post,Subtle Red Flags and BS Feedback at Job,z4d4pu,,"I’m writing this in case it helps other women, esp. POC women, recognize potential, yet perhaps more subtle, red flags at their jobs in tech and tech-adjacent roles. This is also to bring closure for me on a past toxic startup job (PM). Note: I was fresh out of college when this happened.

- __Critiquing you on work that is not yours…__ Yes, this did happen to me several times. For example, manager would give me feedback on how a Kanban board card/task was poorly written, except that I did not write the card. I had to point out the activity stamps on the card to him that I did not write the card: I was a stakeholder in the progress of the task and was asking for a status update.

- __“You don’t sound right…”__ A classic. This piece of “feedback” was the red flashlight that went off, and I realized the ism’s at play. Notice in my scenario, the “you don’t sound confident enough” was given in a way to make it seem collaborative. It may not be stated outright. I was first asked what I thought of my performance answering a coworker’s question on a call. I thought I did fine and gave xyz reasons. The manager had a look of reservation on his face. So I followed up and asked for his thoughts. He thought I sounded not confident and unsure. When I asked for clarification, he could not give any. The call recorded, so in about two weeks time I asked during 1-1 to listening to the call together. After listening to the call together, he actually said (without me even asking) that he actually thought that my answer sounded fine, perhaps he was mixing it up with a previous time when I talked. Notice that this a huge bias - your performance today should not be judged on your performance yesterday; otherwise, all instances of improvement are always invalid in this person’s eye. It also helped with my case that I asked for my coworker who was receiving my answer for feedback on that particular interaction ahead of time. That coworker actually praised the thoughtfulness of my answer and how I followed up afterwards to make sure that my answer was clear.

- __Using very charged language.__ If you are getting negative “feedback” that going something along the lines of “you lack (xyz adjective)” or “you did not (xyz)” or “you seemed (xyz)”, it’s a red flag. First, ask for clarification if they can be specific about what xyz adjective means. Continue asking for more and more specific examples and specific actionable advice. If they cannot come up with either, it’s not quantifiable and thus biases at play. If they can, consider if you can deal with this type of given feedback - these quotes come off as attack on your character rather than critique on your work, and that is not okay.

- __Invalidating your experiences.__ Need I say more? The way I got it was “misunderstanding other people’s intentions”. Huh, interesting to receive this when I have brought up my words are often misinterpreted by others (which btw was brushed aside because the manager “haven’t seen that from others yet” - well, yeah people act differently when different people are in the room. Surprise?). If your experience is brushed aside once, it will be continuously brushed aside.

- __Faced with higher expectations than others in your role.__ This one does not need more explaining but can be hard to document if there are only a few people in your role at your organization. Trust yourself. The burnout is not worth it.

- __Refer to themselves as “your boss”.__ To quote GoT: “A dragon is not a slave.”

*How to protect yourself:*

- Document everything. Document everything like you are going to court. The only way to get your point across when faced with a sexist and/or racist is to present cold, hard facts. Document your interactions, your works, contributes, positive feedback from others (do not be afraid to ask ppl you have a good rapport with). Changing a sexist/racist’s behavior is close to impossible. However, documentation means you can escalate the situation either to higher up, HR, or just shove it all during HR exit interview. This things will come to bite said person. Be tactful and think about bridges, ofc. But also think about your own closure and wellbeing.

- Ask for actionable feedback. Make sure the feedback is specific: the manager should give your feedback that you can easily implement. If anything is unclear, push back. If he is not able to be so, red flag.

- Trust your instincts. Investigate your feelings. You feelings are always 100% valid. In these professional context, knowing how to voice your feelings distinctly makes a world of difference. Ask yourself what particular instance is bothering you. If you want to voice how a person’s actions made you feel, focus on your emotions and the action. Do not let it come off as a pass on their character. Have specific actions they can implement or avoid doing to help you feel more comfortable. Again, don’t have any expectations going into this. Like I said, it is close to impossible to change sexists and racists, but this can help if the other person did not mean to do so. Again, be tactful. Some men have very, very fragile egos, so I’ve learned.

xxstem,hot,2023-10-24 23:52,2020-04-17 23:07,[deleted],Post,Advice?,g3gfgd,,"Hey all-friendly disabled neighborhood post-bacc here. Sorry for the spam as of late. I have cerebral palsy and a non-verbal learning disorder, and it has proven impossible to get accommodations at my institution. I need some help navigating a situation as people with NVLDs are really easily manipulated.  I never know when something isn't my fault, and tend to believe that each time something is blamed on me, that this is the truth.  We struggle to lie.

My current PI is nice, but brand new. Before our doors shut due to COVID-19, we were a lab of one. It was just me. So, because she needed to do PI things, I had to do everything in the lab. Genotyping, running to the stock room, preparing solutions, reading for my own project, doing my own project, dishes, autoclaving, whatever. I'm also a full-time student (3 grad classes, currently. But it's a non-thesis program, so they're work intensive).

Before PI hired me, I told her that my CP made things challenging, and reading took me longer because of my NVLD. She agreed to all of these things that didn't totally materialize after hire (had same issue in last lab, but way worse). She means well, really. I don't think she's a bad mentor, just under tons of pressure.

I want to help and be more effective, but I'm not sure how. We originally divided genotyping when I approached her about needing time to do all of these things, especially because of my fine-motor limitations. When she got back from this week-long development seminar, we were behind with genotyping. I was drowning. When I mentioned the racks weren't divided and it was hard to do it all on top of this other mountain of work, she said that it was clear I wasn't comfortable coming to her to tell her I need help. But the thing is...I do. I think she just gets so overwhelmed, that it's hard to do all of her tasks without the support she needs, so she's naturally stressed.

I get a lot of conflicting directions. She'll tell me my work is great. Yesterday she told me my work hasn't been great-that I haven't gotten all of the genotyping done on time (there was a huge issue with our master mix). But it came without warning after she'd said everything was fine and the work was great. And this was after she was gone for a week and I had like 60 hours of genotyping to do over the weekend because the ears were clipped late (don't have mouse room clearance yet). Originally, she said to me that she didn't want to treat me like a tech.  She also mentioned that she never uses gloves and keeps telling me its fine not to.  So, I didn't run to the stock room immediately when we were out. We never talked about any lab duties, so beyond the very obvious, I had no idea it was my job.  I got in and she was super upset that I hadn't replaced the gloves.  I was going to that day, but like I didn't predict her response because we'd never discussed what my duties were as far as tech things, and she kept telling me she didn't use them. I am not sure how to figure out how to predict what she wants. But I'm sure it can be done if I try harder.

Before hire she said she was very direct. I said, ""Great, people with non-verbal learning disorders need that"", but after hire, I noticed that she would not give corrections. If I would ask, she'd say that something was good, and I'd find out later when she got upset that it wasn't. She has subsequently told me that she struggles being direct. And I get that-it's hard. But I ask for specific feedback, and get very vague, or she isn't honest. She told me yesterday that it was my fault the lab hasn't made progress (all two of us-she and I). And I want to fix it, but I don't know how rational that is or how much I should beat myself up?  I'm trying to be patient and take on the blame, but I guess I'm a little frustrated. She even went as far as saying the work was too much at one time, and offered to hire an undergrad to help with genotyping.  When I went to ask if she'd go ahead and do that, she rescinded the offer.  I'm just under water.  And I feel completely defective.

I just don't know what to do. I understand she's struggling. I want to be supportive. The culture is hard. Her job is hard. There's no PI manual out there that I'm aware of.

I find that I frequently think of suicide because I feel like my disabilities are not conducive to the ""publish or perish"" culture in research, and I love it so much. And I carry a lot of guilt-particularly thinking about her goals and the fact that she isn't reaching her goals because of me, apparently.

I decided to ramp it up to 15 hours a day/ 7 days a week. This way, I know I've tried to do everything I can. I think.

Do any of you do more than that? Is there anyone on here with a disability? I want to do better. I just get confused because I keep asking for clear expectations and then finding out that the ones she gives me, when she does give them, weren't what she wanted. How do I get around this to meet her goals?

She's really nice. I know she's just scared.

I'm sure there are plenty of people on here who run whole labs by themselves-the CP makes it tough, but I can work longer and I bet I can get around the time constraint. I'm not saying that that's like, her fault. Par for the course, I know.

I used to love science and honestly, I low-key want to literally die thinking about work. I don't even know what to do. I'd like her recommendation, so I feel like I have to figure this out at absolutely any and all cost.",5481,testimonial injustice,hey friendly disable neighborhood post bacc sorry spam late cerebral palsy non verbal learn disorder proven impossible get accommodation institution need help navigate situation people nvlds really easily manipulate never know something fault tend believe time something blame truth struggle lie current pi nice brand new door shut due covid 19 lab one need pi thing everything lab genotyping run stock room prepare solution read project project dish autoclave whatever also full time student 3 grad class currently non thesis program work intensive pi hire tell cp make thing challenge read take long nvld agree thing totally materialize hire issue last lab way worse mean well really think bad mentor ton pressure want help effective sure originally divide genotyping approach needing time thing especially fine motor limitation get back week long development seminar behind genotyping drown mentioned rack divide hard top mountain work say clear comfortable come tell need help thing think get overwhelmed hard task without support need naturally stress get lot conflict direction tell work great yesterday tell work great gotten genotyping do time huge issue master mix come without warn say everything fine work great go week like 60 hour genotyping weekend ear clip late mouse room clearance yet originally say want treat like tech also mention never use glove keep tell fine run stock room immediately never talk lab duty beyond obvious idea job get super upset replace glove go day like predict response never discuss duty far tech thing keep tell use sure figure predict want sure do try harder hire say direct say great people non verbal learning disorder need hire notice would give correction would ask say something good find late get upset subsequently tell struggle direct get hard ask specific feedback get vague honest tell yesterday fault lab make progress two us want fix know rational much beat try patient take blame guess little frustrated even go far say work much one time offer hire undergrad help genotyping go ask go ahead rescind offer water feel completely defective know understand struggle want supportive culture hard job hard pi manual aware find frequently think suicide feel like disability conducive publish perish culture research love much carry lot guilt particularly thinking goal fact reach goal apparently decide ramp 15 hour day 7 day week way know try everything think anyone disability want good get confused keep ask clear expectation find one give give wanted get around meet goal really nice know scared sure plenty people run whole lab cp make tough work long bet get around time constraint say like fault par course know use love science honestly low key want literally die think work even know like recommendation feel like figure absolutely cost,"advice, tech, need, work, feel",0.5816997878384774,"manipulate, isolation, reprimand, discounting, inexperienced",0.34268001182798147,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.5305420989739474
girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:31,2019-08-15 22:49,lonelygirl275,Post,"""Worst coder in the world""",cr095e,,"Hi everyone,

I had a bit of a mental breakdown today as I reflected on everything that's happened. I feel like i've been backed into a corner. Its  my second year in university as I was going to another university a year before this. My major at previous university was in a completely different field. I realised that the field was ultimately an ill fit for me and opted to internally transfer into computer science as I had previous experience in coding and was somewhat proficient in mathematics in my highschool years.

I did well in that university, however I soon realised that while that university excelled in the field that I was studying before, it was pretty average for computer science. I then completed an external transfer to another university altogether for computer science.

Everything should have been good- I was accepted into one of the best universities in the country for computer science, I landed a job teaching programming, I had a really good relationship with the IT faculty in the university because I volunteered all the time, I had a solid group of friends... and then one by one, each of those things slowly went to shit.

The job slowly began demanding more and more for less and less. My 'friends' revealed a rather toxic side of them, including males of the group suggesting that I performed sexual acts to get the programming job and  with members of the faculty to be able to speak on panels hosted by the university, or sit on committee meetings ect. In reference to the title, one of the 'friends' yelled ""how the fuck did the worst coder in the world get a job TEACHING kids how to program?"" at a party. Another friend, who was going for a similar position at another company also said that he would be FURIOUS if someone 'like me' could get the job and he didn't. I was failing in my university subjects, something that scares me a great deal and culminated in me crying in front of my lecturer AND my tutor and withdrawing from a subject while failing another one entirely.

I feel like i proved those guys correct when my university results came out. At the suggestion of an advisor, i decided to go part time for university this semester.I refrained from doing any units which require me to do any programming this semester as I want to take a break and try and expand on my skills outside of an assessed environment. But as I try to go through the challenges on codeabbey and codewars, i realised that I might not be smart enough for this. It takes me 30mins to an hour to complete a simple challenge and its just so disheartening slow my progress is.

I'm panicking just thinking about next semester when i'll have to redo the unit I dropped and also the one I failed. I feel so alone.

I really like computer science. I think its very neat, and I like how well mathematics and computer science go together and i'm pretty determined to continue into second year however I really don't see how I can do that when I struggle so much at programming. During the time when I was in the programming unit, most of the girls I met were AMAZING at programming and just 'got' things. Of course I did meet girls who didn't do so well but they, NO JOKE, \*ALL DROPPED OUT\*. There might be girls who are in the middle or even struggling but still managed to do well but I did NOT see them at all during the lectures.

I'm feeling so defeated right now because its starting to feel like i'm going to be one of the girls who drop out, yet again.

I've been taking steps to code, at least 5 hours every week. I also try and look at other people's solutions and try and implement their logic in future challenges. I'm trying to dabble in frontend which i find less stressful and dauntingthan the coding challenges.

I don't have many friends around me right now- I tried reaching out to someone and she told me that she didn't have time for how depressing i'm being.  So I'm turning to this subreddit of hopefully experienced women in tech who can provide some guidance towards  my situation.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you so much for all your kind words and support. I was really scared. I still am. I don't really know what the future holds for me but at this point in time, I'm going to continue with computer science.

I will definitely be taking up on everyone who offered to have a private conversation in the PM's just about anything because if i'm going to be honest it still feels like doom and gloom. I've never done so badly in my life before and no mtter what anyone says, it still feels like i'm the only girl ever to be so tragic at coding and FAIL a unit.

However, I'm taking it one day at a time. I've unfriended most of the people who make me feel bad and completely deactivated all my social media handles (outside of reddit haha). I smashed out half of my assignment on data science last night(hence why I didn't get back to a lot of you) because I've filled next weekend up with activities which will make me happy and likely won't have time to do it during the weekend. I have an older friend who's a software engineer and I promised them that I won't fixate on how slow my progress for one month. Only if I show no signs of improvement after a month of solid coding everyday can I consider dropping out of computer science since they're convinced that i'll improve noticeably in that time.

I do have some pet projects that I am excited to share with you all! I really hope that I can come back here in a year's time with an update where I'm doing well in my classes and am a lot happier!",5540,testimonial injustice,hi everyone bit mental breakdown today reflect everything happen feel like back corner second year university go another university year major previous university completely different field realise field ultimately ill fit opt internally transfer computer science previous experience cod somewhat proficient mathematics highschool year well university however soon realised university excel field study pretty average computer science complete external transfer another university altogether computer science everything good accept one best university country computer science land job teach program really good relationship faculty university volunteer time solid group friends one one thing slowly go shit job slowly begin demand less less friend reveal rather toxic side include male group suggest perform sexual act get program job member faculty able speak panel host university sit committee meeting ect reference title one friends yell fuck bad coder world get job teaching kid program party another friend go similar position another company also say would furious someone like could get job fail university subject something scar great deal culminate cry front lecturer tutor withdraw subject fail another one entirely feel like prove guy correct university result come suggestion advisor decide go part time university semester refrain unit require program semester want take break try expand skill outside assessed environment try go challenge codeabbey codewars realise might smart enough take 30mins hour complete simple challenge dishearten slow progress panic think next semester redo unit drop also one fail feel alone really like computer science think neat like well mathematics computer science go together pretty determined continue second year however really see struggle much programming time program unit girl meet amaze program get thing course meet girl well joke drop might girls middle even struggle still manage well see lecture feel defeat right start feel like go one girls drop yet take step code least 5 hour every week also try look people solution try implement logic future challenge try dabble frontend find less stressful dauntingthan cod challenge many friend around right try reach someone tell time depress turn subreddit hopefully experienced woman tech provide guidance towards situation x200b edit thank much kind word support really scar still really know future hold point time go continue computer science definitely take everyone offer private conversation pm anything go honest still feel like doom gloom never do badly life mtter anyone say still feel like girl ever tragic cod fail unit however take one day time unfriended people make feel bad completely deactivate social medium handle outside reddit haha smash half assignment data science last night hence get back lot fill next weekend activity make happy likely time weekend old friend software engineer promise fixate slow progress one month show sign improvement month solid cod everyday consider drop computer science since convince improve noticeably time pet project excite share really hope come back year time update well class lot happy,"help, make, new, project, colleague",0.6926342938776554,"abuse, rejection, misuse, assessed, abusive",0.5199999999999884,"woman, work, like, people, say",0.5495763263289745
girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:39,2020-01-17 4:21,SquareSprinkles,Post,Heart Broken.,epy4qt,,"I see GHC on here a lot and in women in tech groups. If i'm going to be honest, I thought it was some kind of prescription drug but was quickly corrected when I researched more. The conference looked amazing. Women from all walks of life will be here- united by their love of technology.

There was only one issue. Finances. 

I didn't live in America and even if I did, I do not have the means to just fly out to Orlando. Thankfully, I was aware of a Grace Hopper Down Under conference as I heard down the nerd grapevine that other universities were sending their own women in technology to these conferences. I checked my own university and got nothing. That's alright- I have family members in academia, I know what a nightmare funding can be for admin staff. I searched for alternative routes and tried to find people who also did- there *had* to be someone in my huge university who managed to go.

I was directed to another committee member who went. Imagine my surprise when she told me she was sponsored by my university.

I was shocked. *When did you go?* I asked- it must have been a long time ago as my university didn't advertise it at all

*They sent out the applications last year.*

*What applications?* I asked.

*Oh...they only sent out applications to women who have a HD WAM.* 

My stomach dropped to my feet. I had never felt so stupid before. As if my prestigious university wanted to sponsor someone *like me*. Someone who struggled so much with family issues, with mental health, someone so weak they couldn't even admit that they needed help until they broke down in front of a lecturer in first semester.

I'm not going to lie. I sat in my room and just cried for some time. I felt like I was being penalised for a horrific first semester- for not being able to manage my mental health and stress and work and school life balance. My university's technology faculty prides itself on being diverse and supporting all women, but only women with a HD WAM, right? I never felt like I belonged in the technology, after all, I almost FAILED first semester. Even though I've placed in competitions, been a part of mentoring and academic programmes, i'm reminded again and again that despite it all, it doesn't matter. 

But then I got angry. I remember all the hours I spent volunteering for them. Speaking on their panels. Wearing a University badge as female representative in their tents. While my friends got rides home with their parents, their friends, or lived quite close by, I had to make the 2 hour commute back home to where I lived in the low-socioeconomic and dangerous area of the city because that was all I could afford. It would often be 11pm when I got home as the events were generally held in the evenings and i'd have to have my keys between my knuckles as I knew being mugged wasn't out of the ordinary where I lived. 

But I dedicated my time to volunteer and supoprt these events anyways in spite of my struggles because I wholeheartedly believed in their mission for all women to feel like they belonged. Feel like they were *accepted*.

But then they turn around and say yeah we want women...

...but not women *like you*. 

They'll take my volunteer hours but then turn around and not even give me the decency of knowing such an event existed unless I had the grades they wanted. Never fucking mind my mental health was so bad I was crying in the bathroom stalls pretty much everyday, contemplating suicide because i'm not one of the intelligent female peers who just absorbed information like a sponge and could code like the long lost  Gennady Korotkevich sibling. Never fucking mind I was waking up at 4 to get to work and then going to university afterwards, then going back to work so i could support myself all attributing to my declining grades. Never even mind the fact that I worked my ass off to balance all my activities in the second semester and my lowest grade being a Distinction- yeah never mind that. I don't see that HD average so we're not even going to give you the time of day for this conference that you've dreamed of going, even talked to faculty members about.


Look, I know we have some very high achieving women on here and I know its my own fault for not managing my mental health. I know there are many many women out here who have worse circumstances than me and managed to get stellar grades. I *know* the selection committee only has so much time to cull their applicants and choose the finalists.

*I know.*

So after all this complaining, I'm going to get to work.

My grades were quite good last year- they were a far cry from the previous and I'm not going to just get half HDs, I'm going to aim for full HD's this coming semester.

I'm going to continue to volunteer, not because I support my university, but because I still believe that all women who love technology should feel like they have a place in such a broad and beautiful field. 

I'm going to continue to be a good diversity in tech committee member and promote my university's events, and work my butt off for them because I truly believe everyone should feel like they belonged. Even if they don't have amazing grades.

I'm writing this post here as an accountability measure. Any time I find myself procrastinating, any time I forget just how badly I felt when I realized that I wasn't *good* enough, I'm going to have this page in the background. I remember trying to find women who managed to get sponsored- all were women who had stellar grades. Not one had a single fail on their transcripts whereas I almost failed an entire semester in first semester. I want to emphasize this doesn't mean they had a smooth ride at university- just means we had different struggles in university and I do NOT believe they are any less worthy.

However I want to go to this conference this year alongside my university funded friends and be the role model I desperately needed who could tell- most of all *show*- me that grades do not define you. 

The Grace Hopper Down Under has their own scholarships and I'm going to apply this year. There's going to be more competition than if i just went with my university and they might not even look at me twice because of my horrific first semester but that's okay. I'll come back and update you guys that i didn't get in but I'm going to try even harder next year.

girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:03,2023-09-28 23:34,syrenashen,Post,Ode to my women mentors and women managers,16v0vi3,,"I'm a woman who's been in this industry for 10 years, 15 years including internships. I never coded before college, but due to a large amount of encouragement from both women and men around me, I got a degree in CS against my parents' wishes and my own expectations of myself.

I've been talking to many women in this industry and reading about their experiences here which made me realize how lucky and unique my experiences were (although I don't think it's just luck\*), so I wanted to virtually thank the many women mentors in my life that have helped get me where I am today.

I was lucky to have gone to a school that didn't have a 50/50 ratio in CS but it wasn't far off either. It's an engineering school that consciously tries to maintain a balanced ratio. My CS class was around 60/40 which was really fucking great, so I never had the experience of being the only woman in the class. I didn't know how to code AT ALL, and tbh it was a huge struggle but no one said ""girls shouldn't be here"" or anything to me just because there were so many amazing female role models, professors, TAs, and grad students around.

My first serious internship was an internship at Google. I applied super late because I didn't believe I'd get accepted (I applied in May which, if you have normal summer internship experience, that's very late for an internship that starts in June). There weren't many projects left but someone at Google saw my resume and picked me up and asked for a super late internship slot for me, got it approved, and that was when I got my dream of interning at Google. I learned how to program there. I had never done production-level coding on a team before; most of my schoolwork was solo coding or theory-based so I had not worked with more than 1 person on a codebase. So that internship really taught me a lot.

My mentor was also great; I was out sick for a few weeks during the 12 week internship, and she got an approval to extend the internship a few weeks so I could submit my project and get a return offer. I didn't end up going back to Google, but she taught me a lot. At the time, I felt guilty & thought ""Gee why is this woman spending all of her time teaching me, a clueless noob, the complete basics of coding including how to use the command line? And debugging things for me when things go wrong? This can't be fun or benefitial to her."" I felt like I brought no value as an intern, but she told me that bringing value as an intern is considered going above and beyond.

After that I worked at a company that had almost no women. It was super toxic and people were constantly threatening & harassing each other. I got reported to HR a few times for stupid things like my short skirt bothered people. I left after 6 months.

Then after that I got a job where I had a series of managers. My first manager, a man, was nice to my face but shit talked about me behind my back. People were coming up to me telling me that my manager was disappointed in my progress, thought I was a mistake hire, etc, and I didn't understand why or how to improve because he never said ANY criticism to my face. He always said ""good job"" and didn't bother to give me any direction on what to work on. I cried a bunch after receiving that 2nd-hand feedback, until suddenly my manager quits and I got a new manager, a woman.

Some male co-workers told me my new manager sucked, and I cried again and contemplated switching teams. But she was really nice and supportive. She told me that she would help me get promoted, something my previous manager never ever mentioned. I felt like she cared about me as a person and my growth as an engineer. She maintained a team that was around 50% women. I have a few close friends from that team still. I ended up transferring teams anyway, though I left on a high note, and she gave me glowing reviews to my new team.

My next manager was also a woman, and we were in a satellite office. The team was >50% women. We even had cancel the ""Women in Tech"" ERG chapter in that satellite office because it was too many women. She said it felt like it would be more exclusionary than inclusionary due to the office being >50% women. I didn't get along with her too well due to differences in opinion, but she still treated me fairly. Again, I really appreciated being in such a balanced gender team. I did end up getting laid off during a companywide layoff during COVID, and she cried when I was laid off and was super supportive. She also quit afterwards in protest.

After that, I joined a new company and a team that was again 50% or even >50% women at times, under a woman manager. She was amazing. She was both my manager and my mentor. First of all, she hired me at a higher level than I was expecting. I literally thought there was no way I'd be hired in at that level. So much so that I only found out I was hired at that level *after I joined*. (It was an L for negotiation though.) After that, she got me by far the highest impact projects on the team and promoted me again in 1 year. I never thought I'd be in this position and gained so much confidence from the experience because my previous career trajectory was not going anywhere near that fast. I realized just how important your manager's support is.

Finally, now I started a startup with another woman, a three-time successful founder, and we just got funded by a top VC. I'm super excited and find her super inspirational. In fact, every day I feel lucky that she picked me of all people to work with. She has lots of different strengths that are complimentary to mine, and I learn a lot from just observing her interact with the product & the people around us every day. I feel super lucky.

Anyway, all this to say: TL;DR: Female mentors and managers have been the reason I'm where I am today. Balanced gender ratio teams are fucking awesome. Keep fighting for this world because as someone who has worked with a few male managers and heavily male-dominated teams, it makes a HUGE difference. I've had a few male mentors as well, but this is an ode to my most wonderful, superhuman, generous, kind, inspirational, selfless, extremely competent woman mentors 🙏✨

\*I don't think it's just luck but also selection bias. I think women managers are more likely to hire women, and also women like me are more likely to join teams with more women. I've had offers where I'd be the only woman and that always gave me the ick.

girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:17,2022-09-04 3:15,Instigated-,Post,Perspective please - crappy 'Head of People & Culture' - stay or go?,x5gons,,"# I'd love some friendly advice and perspective on navigating workplace culture and when to walk away. 

**TLDR:** Where I work has a workplace culture that is probably in the top 5%, however I'm sensing red flags from some new leadership that it will likely become more bureaucratic, hierarchal, and less aligned to my values in future (possibly toxic). I don't know whether I should be grateful that it is mostly a good company, or be prepared to look for somewhere I can fully thrive.

**Backstory:**

I have been loving where I work, have a great team, this is the best job I've ever had. I reskilled into software engineering after a previous career, so I am junior in this industry but have over a decade of workplace experiences prior to that.

In my previous career I worked in some places with bad workplace cultures, with the last one being incredibly toxic and damaging. When I made this career change I also did a lot of introspection and reflection and recognised that workplace culture has to be number 1 priority - be a place that is a good match for me, where I can thrive.

There are a lot of behaviours and stuff that are really common in most workplaces, to the point of being normalised, that a lot of people will say ""that's just work"" even if they don't like it. Some people are more comfortable and able to accept things as they are, they just kind of 'switch off' and get on with it.

That's not how I am. I have a real drive to see continuous improvement, to address issues, solve problems, ideate improvements, etc. I don't expect things to be perfect (that's impossible), however I have a need to strive towards it and find it very frustrating to work with people or in a culture where people pretend nothing is wrong or kick the can down the road or are more interested in maintaining the status quo. It stresses me out, and if I do try to adapt I become a small compromised person who feels powerless and disgusting.

I was drawn to the company I work at in large parts because of the values and culture. Nice people, collaborative, supportive, progressive, a startup that is not only trying to be innovative in the product they're creating, but working hard to be a place that people like to work, humanistic with wellbeing days, flexible work hours, a fair amount of autonomy on how we manage our work and time, family friendly, low/no ego environment, fairly flat hierarchy, they hire people who can and will speak up to their managers if they see an issue, do 360 degree reviews, track workplace culture and employee satisfaction and seek to raise the quality - etc. Great in so many ways.

Being a tech company, and a startup, there were things they don't have right yet that they'd like to improve in future. Diversity and gender gap would be an example. Our gender gap is pretty standard for the industry - about 20% women to 80% men in the company, and 15% women to 85% men in technical roles. They assured me they want to work on this, and I do think that is true.

When I joined we had a female Head of People & Culture who was really amazing. Warm, authentic, genuinely caring about the wellbeing of people in the company, personally invested, and no ego about the work.

She moved into a new role in another company, and they hired a new Head of People & Culture. We're also in a period of growth where there has been hiring of several new people in senior management leadership positions and increased focus on international growth (looking outward & scaling, rather than inward).

They make these big change announcements in whole company showcase meetings, with very blue sky optimistic visions, followed by a short period of time for Q&A. I'm the kind of person to ask questions, and about the things that haven't been explained well or covered in the presentation (which, lets face it, tends to be the stuff they might want to gloss over - the challenges, tricky questions).

First contact with the new Head of P&C (let's call him Dave)  was after a big change announcement where I'd asked some questions such as about how we'd maintain what we like in our culture and values as we grow and scale - he reached out to set up a 1:1 between us.

We spoke for over an hour, generally about culture and values of the company. But it was one of those conversations where you're not entirely sure what the other person wants from it, and leave the conversation still not sure whether they got what they were looking for, not feeling like there was clarity gained or exactly where the other person stands. 

Second contact was following another big announcement, this time I didn't ask any questions (other people I knew already raised the q's I might have been inclined towards), and Dave sought me out and started by saying ""I was surprised you didn't ask any questions"".  He then asked me what I thought, and how my views may have changed since we last spoke.

The experience of talking to Dave was disconcerting, like constantly being pushed a little off balance, when you're trying to communicate yet things keep going off direction. 

If he'd been any other colleague, I would probably have walked away after 5-10 mins because of the discomfort (identify this is a person who I may not see eye to eye with), but because we were talking about something I care a lot about (culture and improvement) and he is the Head of People & Culture who in theory might be able to do something about it, I found myself really trying to communicate and help him understand my perspective.

Some examples:

* I give an opinion (which he asked for), Dave wants me to justify it. He asks for an example, I give one, so he asks for a second example, then maybe a third... He doesn't feel any need to justify, prove or explain his own opinions to the same level, and the implication is that if I haven't suitably proven my point (by his impossible standards) that it is somehow weak and unsubstantiated.
* Interrupts me to be picky about semantics of the exact words used, which interrupts my stream of thought and I lose place of what I was trying to say.
* If I make a good point that might be hard for him to disagree with openly, he deflects in some way without acknowledging the point or answering my question. If for example we were talking about gender gap & diversity in our company, he might then give an example of how he improved diversity when he was in a different company, or mention how he had spoken about the exact same thing with a black male friend who'd then pointed out he was the only black person in the team and diversity isn't just about gender - all in all, not really responding to my point or giving any hint of any actions or plans in our company.
* Dave knows the right things to say to be politically correct, so often sounds like 'ok, he gets it', however doesn't seem very authentic or genuine. Well rehearsed soundbites.
* Doesn't feel like he is really listening at a deep level, he smiles and nods, but signals impatience for you to finish talking so he can speak, like what he has to say is more important than what you do. 
* At times was snarky, and normalised the things I was raising concerns about, implying that because some things are common and normal in other companies, and our company is better than most, that I am unrealistic in thinking things could/should be done differently or better.
* At times seemed to be point scoring in trying to take me down a peg.
* Twisted what I was saying to imply that I was complaining about specific people, and that I was questioning their underlying intentions. This derailed to me having to clarify that I don't have any problem with the people making these decisions personally, and I don't doubt they mean well. (Rather than him addressing the issue I was raising).
* Before speaking on diversity Dave will signpost that he knows that as a white, educated, heterosexual male he has privilege and no place speaking on this, but now he's going to mansplain... and proceeds to mansplain. Seeing as he is P&C and we're talking about diversity I don't really care about the mansplaining (this is meant to be his area of professional expertise), what does annoy me is that he doesn't actually do anything to check his privilege, he is very comfortable being snarky and gas lighting me.

&#x200B;

Regardless of the points I was trying to raise with him, whether I was right or wrong, the way he engaged with me in this interaction was a power play (I think), the kind of stuff someone does to sideline someone, to try to make them feel foolish and question themselves or wear them down.

Prior to this exchange I'd put a little bit of initiative and effort into trying to get a women's employee resource group or forum for women up. It was early stages of planning, originally began with talking to the previous Head of P&C and another P&C person who is now under Dave (who seems to worship the ground he walks on). I wanted to help the company meet it's diversity goals, and thought it was important to create a safe women-led space that could gather some insights that didn't have other opportunities to be heard. (Also: I am the only woman on my team and have no other women to compare notes on when feeling isolated because of the gender gap).

I'm now feeling that with someone like Dave heading up People & Culture, that the culture of the place is likely going to deteriorate (at least on the things I value), and it's not worth my while to invest more of my time and energy into ""extras"" outside my role when 

(a) it might bring me more into contact with Dave who I don't want to have anything to do with, 

(b) I'm not sure I will want to be here in a year's time considering this new leadership, if the culture deteriorates, and 

(c) if Dave operates the way I think he does, he's going to be trying to sideline me and damage my reputation (people who operate politically consider freethinkers a threat, they want people to fall into line).

However, I also know that this company is still very good in so many ways, and I don't take that for granted - having worked in some really bad places before. I'm not sure how easy it will be to find an employer that is a better match for me, and don't want to jump 'out of the pan and into the fire'. I also don't know if I am blowing things out of proportion.
