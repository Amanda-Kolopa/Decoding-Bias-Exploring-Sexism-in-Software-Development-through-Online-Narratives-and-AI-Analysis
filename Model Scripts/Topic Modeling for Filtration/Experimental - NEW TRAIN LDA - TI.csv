I'm 5'9, blonde hair blue eyes with an excessively large chest (I've been told they are a 'gift'  from God by my grandma, and a 'curse' by my chiropractor, but only saying this to explain they are real and not a chioce). I also happen to be the head of HR for the entire Americas Region for a company comprised of mostly a bunch of male engineers.  I get respect.  They are nerds. They joke with me.  They invite me out to lunch with the group even though I know for a fact my looks are intimidating to at least a couple of them (we can totally tell by the way).   

So after spending 6 years in hr in tech specifically(15 overall), I will acknowledge, nerds sometimes lack in social skills, but at no point should that be anyone else's problem except for their own.  You basically told her, ""well what did you expect walking in here looking all sexy and exotic, next time if you want to be accepted try not showering for a week and wear stained t-shirts once in a while, geez, they're only human!"" FYI - I know women who do this, but the problem with this approach is when it comes to promotions, no one wants to promote the slob who doesn't shower.  You try walking that fine line, the goal is to look nice but not nice enough to be fuckable, and if you slip off that very fine line you get labeled as ""slutty"" or trying to sleep her way to the top.  I know, I've been accused of both and both accusations are false but that one time I showed cleavage at a formal event sooooo... 

Here's how the conversation should have went.  ""You are concerned no one's talking to you,  I wouldn't take it personally, these guys have been stuck in basements for the past 2 years and forgot how to talk in real life, and to be honest they weren't that polished before.

Nerds, am I right, excuse me, I'll be right back""....

Discreetly take the team members aside who are acting like 12 year old boys and remind them they are in a professional work environment and not a junior high dance,  they they have are expected to treat her as a member of the team AND remind if they can't be on a team with an attractive female, it will be them leaving the team not her.  

Besides,  again from an HR perspective, you may want to check labor laws in your area. There are special restrictions to employing minors. I fully get that there are 12 year old boys who are my tech savvy than I'll ever be, but that doesn't mean you can hire them to work in your IT department.  You might be okay if the guys on the team are between 16 - 18, but you'll need to check your state laws, usually they have working hour restrictions....  unless I misunderstood and these are actually grown men, in which case... wtf really?

""Why is everyone acting so weird around me?"" asks the new team member. 
 ""Your teammates get boners around you and they can't concentrate properly.""
Now,  that's the truth,  right?
But,  saying the actual truth is ... inappropriate, at least to the majority of Reddit's readers. To speak this truth is the height of both bluntnesss and a lack of human class. 

All those condemning the OP as an A-hole are not wrong,  but certainly not right. The entire team has issues with their ability to self-control around a new team member who triggers their instinct to sexual attraction. Yes,  it's easy enough for Reddit's woke mob to demand that these guys BE BETTER, but the fact is : THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTROL THEIR BEHAVIOR WHEN THEY ARE SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO A TEAMMATE. Don't be confused. because this not an excuse. Would you be angry at a child who can't stop biting their nails or making clicking sounds in their throat? Adult men who've not been properly taught how to control their emotions on this issue are to be pitied, and gently educated about how to become more mature.  The more they are angrily condemned and shamed, the more difficult it becomes for them to effect positive change in their personal development. 
The OP is in a difficult situation because he appears to know this is poor behavior, and the new coworker specifically asked what the problem was,  as she sensed something was strange. He thought telling her the truth was the best decision. 
 
If you feel telling the truth should be punished because it made the new coworker uncomfortable,  -and that this constituted sexual harassment, according to some other Redditors in this thread- you are entitled to that opinion of course. I simply disagree. Yes, the OP perhaps lacked judgement in their decision to speak the unpleasant truth; but this makes only them unwise. 

Being an asshole , at least in my opinion,  requires intention, and not just ignorance.

The larger issue I want you to consider  is just simply that of the reality we all share.  

Not everyone shares your values and sense of what is correct behavior. How men Should and Could treat women has been an issue since the beginning of the human species. How much sexual attraction can and does disturb the focus of many men has been a known issue since forever. It certainly is a problem, and different cultures have vastly different traditions and expectations on the subject.  

These issues won't change for the better until a clear acceptance of what the problem is (lack of emotional self control) and how to address it and improve upon it becomes a shared understanding across first a nation, and then,  hopefully in some distant future,  across the world. 

This issue was the true metaphorical teaching at the heart of the Western Christian tradition of the Garden of Eden. The sex organs ARE the  metaphorical fruit of the tree of good and evil.  They can give great pleasure and contentment  when used and controlled responsibly, or they can be a source of great evil when used selfishly or with violence. Upon this correct understanding, the future of the human species has always turned. The more a culture practices love and mutual respect between All men and women (and those in the non-binary middle zones between them), the more  successful and happy they will be.  The less? A culture riddled with misogyny,  sexual trauma and guilt,  and unintended children, many without loving parents, who carry on the legacy until they become wise enough to break it.

And don’t give me that whole “you’ve never been awkward before in front of someone u find attractive?” Why? Well I’m glad u fucking asked.

(1) Just to confirm. When you find someone attractive, you tend to say racist things? 

How is that being awkward. That is a level far beyond awkward. Veryyy specific choice of terminology you use have to use there. Must be in your typical vocabulary otherwise why would you default to saying it when ur “awkward” because ur “oh so terribly overcome by a woman’s looks”. 

Odd. most men don’t seem to actually default to that. 

(2) also just to confirm, you sexually harass women when you find them attractive too?

So again. Your default awkward state is to be sexist and to sexually harass women. Glad to know that’s also so normal for you that you default to it when in an “awkward” situation . 

Huh. Somehow again most men don’t actually do that. 

(3) Presumably you’ve worked with women before, or even *gasp* talked to them, as that’s basically half of the entire world’s population. 

So. You are completely incapable of treating them like a person (aka with any semblance of respect) purely because you find them attractive? You are COMPLETELY incapable of talking to them? Or collaborating together? And you are completely incapable of overcoming your inability to do this? So much so that you literally run away when they are close? Even though it is your JOB to work with them? 

I mean wow how genuinely childish! Attractive woman in ur vicinity —> ahh you blundered bc ur so “entranced by her looks” (eugh I want to throw up after saying that) —> oh no Can’t work with them because of how they look! —> run away and give the silent treatment suddenly and make zero attempt. Like come on mate, literally almost every kid I know is better than that. 

Hmm how odd again! Seems like pretty much everyone else here was able to. 

But yes of course poor men. how sad it is that you can’t control your impulses. How sad it is how hysterical you get. I feel bad for you and your “men”. 

(4) Ah sorry (not really), to confirm again: you think with your dick to the almost-unbelievable point where the ONLY thing you can point out about a woman who is attractive to you is that they are…attractive? 

Nothing deeper there? You cannot think about someone you like further than that? Wow. 


(5) ah okay so your Average man acts like a racist, a sexist and runs away with their tail between their legs when they encounter someone attractive? Huh. Interesting choice group of people you interact and surround yourself with. 

(6) last one because I cannot be arsed to waste another second on you. You are SOOOOO dense and lack so much reading comprehension that the only thing you’ve taken away by everyone else’s comments is that…people act awkwardly? Even though they’ve explained in pain-staking detail and simple terminology EXACTLY why OP and u are wrong and it is far more than mere “awkwardness”? are their words too big for u? 

I mean between your cowardice, sexism, racism, and all around density and stupidity, you Really must not have anyyy women interested in u (other than ur mum if she’s still in ur life or unless u somehow find her attractive too). Youd have to hole up alone or somehow only among other men who are just as daft and shitty as you, and work together to avoid all women at all costs!! Because women are, according to you, so scary!!

If your boss has an issue with that, then message your boss directly every time she messes with you to ask permission to reprioritize for whatever it is she is demanding.

If she picks you apart in front of people -- try this, when she says something rude, start writing it down, give it a date and timestamp, then ask her to repeat it so you can get your notes correct so that it's (to her) ""done to your specifications"". Then reiterate it -- i.e. ""If I understand correctly, you're saying the site report looks like it could have been written by a 3 year old and that you believe I am not conducting myself appropriately; what you like for me to do to rectify this?""

If she thinks you're incompetent (or whatever it is she's saying) GIVE her incompetent, require specifications for her changes, and make absolutely *sure* that *she* will be happy. Your boss may become uncomfortable about this and ask about it -- you need to be absolutely sure that you are sincere during all of this; it's clearly a problem and you've complained about her demands previously and since no changes were asked of her, for behavior you felt was toxic, that perhaps you've misunderstood and are now adapting to the supported planning matrix she is providing as a project manager.

It is very important you are very detailed in this approach and take it very seriously. I find that following rules to the letter is the only way to get them changed. If this is compliance, and it clearly must be as the business seems to fully support it, be in compliance.

Also, to answer your last question - she does it BECAUSE it hurts and she wants to hurt you. No one is stopping her because they are cowards. Make them work to continue this. Make sure you carry a notebook and take notes for their prioritized shenanigans.

Continue to report things to HR to be filed under ""toxic work environment"". Make sure they're aware of this person and your efforts to try and work with them. Scan the notes to your private email address daily. Always have receipts, keep everything, cover your butt always so that you can copy/paste in response to any new shenanigans. If others do this, give them the same treatment, and if you can get their garbage in writing, in an email, that's the best. Forward those to your personal email also.

Since there was some misunderstanding on the last post, I just wanted to clarify that I'm not asking for interpretation of this story. I'm just sharing it, venting a little, and wondering how to handle condescending comments from men in the tech industry in the future. I'm concerned about how to handle sexist / condescending comments in the workplace, and I want to go in knowing how to handle it once I'm able to start applying for programming jobs.

It is definitely great advice but if you’re anything like me (the least confrontational person you’d ever meet), it might be easier said than done. Taking the Gandhi approach has been working for me way better, so the following is YMMV. 

* **Start by assuming that everyone has a level of respect for you and you can only lose it.** 
* Give people the benefit of the doubt and assume that whatever they said was not meant as offensive. Stick to the HR rule: if HR would have trouble ruling it as inappropriate, then let it pass and prove them wrong later. Worst way to lose someone’s respect is be all bark and no bite.
* Actions speak way louder than words and it works both ways here. First, Peers can say whatever they want to you, but if they’re not actively messing with your day to day life, ignore them, move on. Second, say less and do more. Remember, no one can read your mind, even if it’s filled with imposter syndrome thoughts. But, they *can* see what you’re doing so use this opportunity to show the naysayers that you can produce. If you give them words, they can use the words to argue. Can’t argue with results. 
* Build trust by being a good listener. Honestly, I didn’t expect this to happen, but because doing the above for a  year I became known as the quiet, chill girl, so people started going to me for advice.  One very senior guy once went to me first with his big idea and when I asked why me, he said that I’m “the only one around here who doesn’t have a stick up their ass”. We then got to discuss his project and he actively took my technical advice, even though I’m several levels his junior. I’m now a part of several high profile projects and these older dude engineers have my back. 

For comparison, a female coworker of mine has the worst combination: she’s very assertive and doesn’t take shit from anyone, but her impostor syndrome is too severe. What ends up happening is she calls people out if they’re condescending, but then she dwells on it and starts believing it. So not only does it set her back on her work, but it also puts pressure on her to produce, plus reinforces the stereotype for her. Others started to notice and now walk on eggshells around her.

TL;DR: act as if your male peers have the same amount of respect for you as other male peers. Don’t lose this respect by accidentally fitting the “women take everything emotionally and out of proportion” stereotype. Instead, move on, vent to someone outside work if needed, and do your job to prove people wrong.

Here's a calculator for you: [https://www.checkmarket.com/sample\-size\-calculator/](https://www.checkmarket.com/sample-size-calculator/)

Here's an article using plain english explaining the concept: [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/howcan\-a\-poll\-of\-only\-100/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/howcan-a-poll-of-only-100/)

Essentially it's all about math. If you have a massive box full of 126 million pieces of paper of different colours, and you draw out 2500 pieces of paper you can determine how many of each colour likely exists in the box based simply on probability. Similar to the concept that if you roll a 20 sided die 126 million times, you're going to get each outcome a roughly equal number of times \(unless the die is weighted or something.\) 

It's all about probability. Once you have that many samples in the data set it becomes very unlikely that your data is incorrect \- assuming you randomly selected and did not intentionally target certain groups to bias the result. 

The number of businesses doesn't really matter that much, because we're not studying business practices but the behaviour of women. And we're not making conclusions about those businesses. Without a link to the study it would be hard to really speak to, but there are only 18,500 businesses with 500 or more employees in the US so a sample size of 800 gets your margin of error between 3\-4&#37; with 95&#37; confidence.

As you can see from the article I linked above, women actually knew when to negotiate and when to not negotiate (when negotiation was likely to fail), suggesting that women may be able to “ read the room” for pay negotiation and determine themselves that negotiation would result in failure. This provides an interesting insight into this debate, as it suggest women, having grown up in an environment of discrimination in which pay discrimination is one facet, may actually be making the “smarter” decision in not negotiating, as the choice is between not negotiating and less pay/not being hired versus not negotiating and more pay.

However, as you will note, the study I referenced is a laboratory controlled scenario (the second is not), opening the potential for this not to play out in reality.

What the studies to suggest, unequivocally, as I indicate in my first sentence above, is that every position is in some way political/philosophical and serves a social function. In other words, broad social acceptance of one position as “the right explanation” has [potentially unintended] consequences.

What is the consequence of blaming the individual fully and completely for this issue [the most extreme position of the perspective you provide above]? 

The consequence is that the opportunity to investigate/determine whether a systemic social issue is at play is avoided. 

If low pay is the fault of the women who fails to “lean in,” the systemic issue of offering lower pay to women or [as investigated by the articles above] punishing women for negotiating goes uninvestigated and unexamined.  This serves a secondary [and again, perhaps unintentional] purpose as it absolves businesses [and perhaps greater society] from fault. 

It’s not that businesses don’t take kindly to “bitches” or “bossy” women who ask for a raise or demand a higher offer to accept a position, it’s that the women [who perhaps perceive this antagonistic atmosphere] failed to negotiate. Then prominent female feminist businesswoman and Ivy League business schools don’t have to examine how structural issues perpetuated by their protégés or graduates result in an environment which promotes women being paid less. 

It’s easier if it’s individual sexism, not systemic or entrenched sexism just as it’s easier if the environment can be saved by individuals turning off their faucets between brushing their teeth as opposed to a major revamp of agrabusiness. Or [a more exaggerated example to illustrate my point] if segregation were just an individual disagreement some [black] students had with their local movie theater or restaurant. 

My point was merely that reframing the argument is useful and provides insight. I would never want to suggest failing to negotiate pay is not an issue, as there is a clear benefactor in that as well, but who benefits from non-nuanced arguments?

I was laid off from both. I also have a degree in CS. I’m currently scrambling to re-study data structures and algorithms, as well as general interview prep. I have no issues getting interviews and passing phone screens, but once I hit the technical interview portion, I freeze up. I also don’t know a lot when it comes to DSA and trade offs in using different technologies, and I forget a lot of stuff about past projects I’ve worked on. Am I just a bad software engineer? Even if I am, what are the ways I can improve? Or am I just not cut out for this career? How can I retain info better?

What I’m doing now:
- mock interviews with friends
- leetcode M-F
- reading CTCI and considering watching the MIT courses on DSA
- udemy courses on tech stacks I’m interested/software patterns and design

EDIT: Thanks so much for the overwhelming support! It has really lifted my spirit and encouraged more of a growth mindset in myself. To those who may be struggling with some similar issues, I’ll post some key takeaways when I have more time.

EDIT 2: Key takeaways
- practice makes perfect, including live coding/DSA problems
- on retaining info: keep a journal of work you have done. Challenges, what you liked, technologies, etc.  This is useful for interviews as well as performance reviews and aiming for a promotion/raise. 
- being slow is not necessarily a bad thing. Every company thinks they’re fast paced, even when they’re not. If you’re “slow”, avoid small startups, but not necessarily large startups. 
- it takes time to learn the sheer minimum breadth and depth of topics to grow as an engineer. Personal note, I compare myself and my growth to other engineers often, and as they say, comparison is the thief of joy. You shouldn’t use others as a benchmark for your own growth. 
- taking care of your mental health is always important, but especially for anxiety with interviews or depression with rejections. Consider talking to a therapist, career coach, or something similar.

I'm a woman and a software engineer, but I also already finished my degree and never really looked into bootcamps. That being said, my thoughts:

I've looked through your bootcamp website and I noticed a couple things that were kind of off-putting if I was someone considering spending $10k.

For one, I understand that the vibe your website is going for is ""playful"", but at times it felt kind of ... snarky, and detracted from the professionalism of your program. E.g.

> Students are accepted based on personality and enthusiasm. *If you’re a jerk*, or you’re *boring*, It’s not in our best interest for you to become a designer: **because** WE will have to use the things you design.

I can tell you that this pitch is entirely unappealing to me, especially with all the formatting inflections (italics/bolding). It's needlessly aggressive and assumes the worst about me, an applicant demographic who may already be unsure about my place in this industry. You can have high standards for who you accept into your program, but it's more inviting if you state them as positives instead of guarding against negatives.

There were other things too that made me question the polish of your program, for example under one video it says:

> Time is your most valuable asset. {{this video is out of date}}

It definitely gives off the vibe that your website (and by extension the program itself) are still under construction, and makes me question whether the $10k price tag is warranted if the product isn't finished yet. 

Next, your ""apply now"" page honestly fills me with social anxiety:

> You don’t want to be one of those people who get on a call with us and haven’t read about the school or watched any of the videos.

-

> _If_ you understand what we’re doing and you think you’d be a good fit, you can meet us on a Zoom call

-

> If we aren’t a match, we will know because things will feel _weird_.

It feels condescending. These things are all common sense -- come to an interview prepared, hope for good vibes -- but to have them stated so plainly as negatives, almost like you're expecting me to fail at preparing and understanding the point of your program, is a deterrent for me. Is this how the instructors would treat me too? ""_If_ you think you understand this, be prepared to be proven wrong..."" :(

Also, like someone else mentioned, nowhere is there any mention of scholarships for gender minorities. There is no FAQ page about payment plans or programs, or DEI statement linked in the footer of the page.

I appreciate this feedback.

I just realized that even though it is deleted, it will let me write here. We though we were helping let the student off the hook. As in if *they* felt like it was a bad fit then we were not going to try and high-pressure sales them into anything. Many of our past students have gone through many different funnels like career karma before they get to us and we want to make sure that they know it's just an open conversation to see if their goals align with what we're teaching and how we're teaching it.

As far as polish, we would agree. But we are just more excited about the things the students are doing. We threw up that site in a few days - and things just started and we haven't had time to deal with it since. But thank you for your feedback. We talk to people about scholarship options based on what we discuss when we meet. That needs to be covered in a more personal conversation. We've never turned anyone down based on money. Which I'll say here since this thread is basically private now. \[\[EDIT: Apparently this has been retroactively *not* deleted by mods? OK. Weird\]\]  Everything is tricky these days. The word ""Scholarship"" can bother people, being given something can be seen as something being taken away from someone else. It's tricky. Which is partially why I made this post. And it has revealed a lot of great information. We work out pricing plans on a sliding scale based on the person and their needs. We're either bad *people* \- or bad *business people* either way you look at it.

""You don’t want to be one of those people who get on a call with us and haven’t read about the school or watched any of the videos."" We didn't consider that this might sound condescending, but more of a playful/helpful reminder to prepare their questions. We had so many people coming to the meetings who seemed like they had no real interest in the industry. This will be fixed when we start giving out a practice project to apply. But thanks for telling us about that.

""You can have high standards for who you accept into your program, but it's more inviting if you state them as positives instead of guarding against negatives"" - this is helpful. I posted this just before our new website is finished. The new copy is much more about explaining why (not for us) (but for student success) people need to be really enthusiastic about the medium and not just loosely interested in tech. I can't go into that here, but for the student's sake, they need to know that this only works if they meet us halfway. They need to have high standards for themselves in order to succeed in this field. I think that most teachers would agree about that in general. We're just not explaining it very well yet.

What attracted me to my program that I don't feel with yours:

- accreditation: my bootcamp is recognize by two major colleges in the area and completing it can put you 15 credits into a degree.
- credibility: they're not only working with the state on a close level to get and stay credible, all of the people are engineers who have actually worked in the industry from the bottom up. 
- job security: they work post bootcamp to help get people tied to jobs 
- other outreaches- they started helping teach underprivileged children to code, then high-schoolers, now they work with adults. they're expanding to another state.
- an emphasis on humans: they have info on everyone in their organization from the ground up on the website, pics of previous students, pics of their building- you name it.

What I see on your website:
- a lot of very long, drawn out and bad UX/UI. ditch highlighting, ditch emojis and cut out the bs if you want me to take you seriously. I'm a serious person who seriously wants to code  and quit a full-time, serious job to do so. your website is your first impression to me, and I don't trust you to teach me seriously based on it. 
- I also graduated in English. reading a 3 paragraphs that can be summarized in 1 sentence makes you feel incompetent at communication.
- no sense that you are reliable or have any accreditations. 
- no indication that you are real people: who are your instructors? what's their education? where are your graduates? it's your responsibility to provide this. Do it mainly with photos, not videos. Your videos are too long and ramble on. That's not bad if you're a YouTube streamer, but it's not good if you're trying to attract prospective students and just confusing them more.
- confusing design-  It seems less like a site and more like a blog post on Tumblr. **Why would I go to you to learn to make websites if you can't make a website that looks polished and runs smooth as butter?**
- no schedule at all of anything.  give dates for cohorts, give times making note of the timezone you're in, if you're looking to do this online
- overall, a very patronizing tone. You need to understand that if you're trying to convince beginners to enter this that it's scary and every ""we don't accept everyone"" statement or ""not reading about us would be a big red flag"" - that turns people away. You sound almost like an MLM with the ""we're not like the other guys"" approach. the language you use all throughout things is trying to break things down (I think)  just is vague and confusing to people looking to learn baby's first Javascript.  
- you have to have a Mac. do you really? doesn't seem very accessible and there are sites you can easily use for free to provide coding environments where a Mac wouldn't be necessary. to me again, this speaks to incompetence. you're also drastically slashing your cohort, you'd instantly lose a lot of people who are naturally into computers because most power users tend to run PCs. 
- what is the focus? no, everything is not a good answer. I choose to do a bootcamp that was for fullstack web development because it was clear what I would learn and wouldn't, and the skills they teach me will help me to go on and learn any other number of languages, frameworks, etc in the future.

A meritocracy cannot truly exist until the people being judged on merit are being judged fairly, and have come from reasonably equal beginnings.

There are many unconscious biases that women face just for being women.

There are several studies that show a piece of work will be considered less valuable if people believe it to be the work of a woman.

Women who join predominantly male industries are far more likely to leave due to the fact that they will be vulnerable to sexual assault lower pay, and discrimination socially and professionally.

As for your claim that women aren't as passionate about tech... I challenge that claim, plenty of women are passionate about tech but deal with a lot of bulshit and slowly burnout.

You seem to believe that only men can be passionate and nerdy when it comes to technology and that's because it's been marketed to you that way through the media. Because women in the media are generally only there as a plot device for men, or to be sexualized in general. Nerdy techy girls are not generally considered hot, therefore never get any screen time, unless it's to be the butt of a joke.

The irony is that computer work, specifically programming used to be seen as predominantly secretarial work, meaning ""women's work."" When the technology industry stopped appearing this way to men, women were quickly shoved out of the industry, where previously there had been a nearly 50/50 split between men and women in the industry it was now predominantly men with almost no women in an industry.

I am a woman who has been in tech for 13 years I studied technology and dropped out due to sexual assault being stalked by a fellow classmate and having my work ""lost"" or told it was sub-par because I refuse to date the tutor.

Yes I persevered through this, but I shouldn't have had to?
I don't think anyone could blame me for not wanting to, how could you blame anyone for not wanting to go through that?

Had there been other women around me I wouldn't have felt so isolated and alone and likely would have been able to stand up for myself knowing there would be a group of people who would know how I felt and support me, you may think that men can do this for women and perhaps they can, but they very rarely do.

Instead I failed the class and worked my way up in the i.t. industry another way.

As a man in technology you will never have anyone doubt your work based on your gender, you will never have anybody isolate you because of your gender... 

When you are assertive you will be seen as a leader, when women are assertive we are seen as pushy, or bossy, or nagging. If you ever so choose to have a family it will have a positive impact on your career statistically, if a woman chooses to have a family it will statistically have a negative effect on her career. 

Until such a time these gaps in equality are addressed I think it is completely necessary to have programs such as scholarships in order to encourage more women in the industry and balance the unfairness that currently exists in favour of men.

And last but not least, don't think that, that one sentence you said about dispassionate men even came close to the massive rant you made about women and how horrible you think they are, and how undeserving you think they are.

For myself, I grew up in very cisessentialist environments - smart boys are just better at certain kinds of creative, problem-solving activities and ""thinking"". Smart girls follow rules and instructions when told to and stay out of the way otherwise. 

The results in - not asking questions, not seeing yourself in certain roles, not feeling ""allowed"" to experiment or peek, not wanting attention, etc. 

This is not just a gender issue - many cultures teach their kids that this is the way to act in Western/white workplaces. But these barriers get in the way of effective problem solving. 

As for what your company can do:

Form long-term mentorship relationships with young people. There are plenty of summer and after-school coding programs but the rate at which kids leave coding is still pretty high. They'll likely have other barriers like family not understanding their passion or needs (focus time, effort that doesn't result in grades, electricity, etc), insufficient basic education (reading comprehension, arithmetic, reasoning skills), emotion regulation when faced with new scary things or imposter syndrome, etc. This way, you'll be able to influence the attrition rate before college (declaring majors).

If you want to retain the diverse talent you already have:

Train your employees to learn about the ways systems of oppression affect individuals and how that can show in different behaviors. At minimum, train your employees to realize there are consequences for being unwilling to learn.

Train people to recognize when discrimination occurs, even when it is legal and even when people are doing and saying all the right things. Too many times, allies have stood by and told me I was imagining things, only to be shocked when things became definitively illegal harassment or retaliation. 

Conversely, I was so used to giving people chances that there were a few times when allies with less institutional power took me aside to tell me I was being treated unfairly and I didn't recognize it because everyone else sounded like they were saying and doing the right things. It took me a long time to realize the rubric I was being assessed with was not the same as the rubric for everyone else.

Because tech is still seen as a 'passion' field. And nobody cares about training, everything is just 'teach yourself'. I got my first computer at 16, I didn't even know CS degrees existed and after uni I fell into a technical role by accident but every single day I feel I don't belong here. It's nothing to do with my team, they're all amazing and supportive despite me being the only woman, and the youngest.

\- Everybody's story is 'I started coding when I was 10 blah'

\- Constant talk about video games, some new technical thing, nobody really discusses normal topics.

\- No training, you're expected to 'learn everything' by yourself unpaid and everyone around you already knows what they're doing because they spent 20+ hours tinkering on the weekends.

Now these things in isolation are fine! In fact from an unconventional background I wouldn't have made it without my weekend work, as we speak I'm keeping an eye on my pipelines. But the general MESSAGING is that tech is a thing only for those obsessed with it who 'fit the mould'. You can't be here because you're reasonable good at it , want to make decent money and generally want to go home at 5, live your life. IMO those who WANT to surge ahead, fine, but constant grinding to the detriment of everything else shouldn't be an industry norm.

I do a lot of outreach events, for interns/grads etc the majority of women even those who do CS/Engineering end up going into PM, tech recruiting or similar roles after a couple of years in the job because of this. It's hard to battle the imposter syndrome. FWIW I genuinely love all of this, if I wasn't tinkering around I'd just be reading books so it's not like I'm sacrificing a brilliant social life. But I'm starting to question whether it's worth it. Especially after kids somehow the mental load always falls to the woman anyway you get further and further behind.

If you want to attract more women (or anybody who's unconventional really) - the main thing you should highlight is your support for technical pathways. Training people at work time costs the company, as opposed to just hiring those who will happily put in huge amounts of time at home. Companies already short on devs expect new hires to be productive. By contrast nobody would ever let a junior doctor loose on patients, or a junior accountant loose on financial statement production without a lot of handholding.

Also if it's female technical staff you're after make sure you highlight them. I've lost count r.e. the number of times I've turned up to D&I events and every 'woman in tech' was a project manager, HR staff, or similar.

I grew up without a father, so I was oblivious to the gender split in IT when I was a kid (oblivious to gender roles in general). I was into horses and was - naturally - on a horse website where the way you made profiles... was by typing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript lmao. Such an old website. I obviously wanted a cool profile - that's how I got into learning these three languages. Loved how getting things to work was like solving puzzles and mysteries. Then I got into PHP, SQL, from there on python, etc. Creating stuff gave me a dopamine rush like nothing else.

After a few years, I slowly started noticing how talking passionately about my programming hobby was *not* getting the same reaction like talking about my horse riding hobby. I started not talking about it at all. I made a programming friend online, that ended pretty soon after he made the ""do you know how to make a sandwich"" joke. Every girl I talked to got their computer fixed by their dad and barely knew what a browser was.

I tried getting into multiplayer online gaming as well, but quickly restricted myself to playing solo games. I told myself I just like solitary activities, but the truth was, I hated how gamers talked about women. I hated the avatars. I started hating being a woman.

In high school, I hated how all my programming friends eventually wanted something romantic when I did not. I hated how even when they didn't say anything insulting, I felt like an outsider. Like an imposter. Even if people are nice to you, it's uncomfortable being the only one of a type, be it gender, colour, diagnosis, whatever.

So I went into biomedicine. I'll tell you what, I fucking hated biomedicine. Here I am, graduated after five years, in a - guess what - programming job. Can't run from what you love, I guess. I like the work, but I lost a lot of experience the last five years compared to computer science students, and I still feel like the odd one out.

So in short, I 100% believe it's society that kills women's entry into computer science. All the guys talking about ""how women maybe just naturally aren't interested in this stuff"" are stupid. Remove girls from any form of gender split environment, and they'll 100% have an interest. Kids imitate the people around them, especially adults. If no women are going into computer science, who are they going to imitate, who are they going to look up to and follow? If dad is the handyman, why should they pick up any sign they should follow when mom is clueless? Who wants to go into a field where you know you're gonna be the odd one out, and where you feel an invisible resistance before even starting? Social pressure is at its peak at the age you have to pick a major.

Are there even enough women interested in your kinda work? 20 years ago (i live in switzerland) they tried their hardest to get women into tech-support and IT-based jobs over here.

&#x200B;

They basically tried to push every girl to do some technical work. Even if they didn't really want it.

When these girls enrolled into their apprenticeships (instead of studying you have something called a ""Fachlehre"" in Switzerland where you basically are a paid trainee for 3-4 years, learning the job and studying at the same time. It's basically a paid for bachelor of science degree with practical experience, but i digress).

Even besides these efforts (and certain companies only employing women/girls) when i started my apprenticeship in 1999. There were 80 men. And 4 Women.

One year later there were 160 men and 20 women.

In general it ended up with a ratio of 10-15% women.

However.

The Drop-Out-Rate for men was about 10%. For women it was about 50%

They got pushed into jobs that they didn't even want to do and that they didn't like.

In the past 20 years, wherever i worked (and i worked in banks, pharmaceutical companies, ensurance companies etc.) there were ever hardly any female Techies. The ones that were there, were the best coworkers i could wish for.

Smart, Hard-Working. Way better workers than most men i worked with. But there were almost none to be found. When sending out job offers in the field. You receive 200 applications. 90-95% of the applications are men.

And employing more women just to fill a quota won't solve the underlying issue, that there are just not enough women in the field. At least not over here.

I don't know how it is in the US so i'd really like to learn more about it.

&#x200B;

Over here it's a very slow increase. Due to girls being taught early, that women and men can do engineering jobs or work in a daycare we slowly start to narrow the gender-gap. But when i was back in school girls still learned how to sew and boys learned how to do woodwork. And 30 years later this is the work environment i find myself in.

&#x200B;

The issue with women dropping completely out of the workforce is also an issue we currently discuss over here. Because society in general thinks a man should be working and a woman should be a mother, the women usually take care of the kids.

Also often only the man gets paid enough to support a family. (Hello Wage-Gap which is ALSO another issue by itself).

&#x200B;

[Chart and discussion here](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2015/01/10/chart-of-the-week-what-happened-to-women-in-computer-science/)

The short of it is that back when it was mechanical adding machines and slide rules ""computing"" was designated as women's work, because it's kinda secretarial, I dunno I guess.  

When programmable computing machines started to become important for engineering work, programming and operating them fell to women.  But home computers were marketed heavily as a father-son activity (many early ones were built from kits, like kit radios) and this lead to more young men going to school with some awareness of BASIC and assembly.  Then because sexism and laziness, schools confused prior experience with ability and didn't bother to accommodate novices.  So when the web bubble happened, it was mostly men getting rich.  A locker-room culture of acceptable sexual harassment emerged.  The gamer-to-tech pipeline solidified.  Women were and are further discouraged from programming careers by the reasonable fear that we'll be treated like crap.

Women are perfectly capable.  In my high school experience, young women were very much over-represented in math team and the top-track math classes, even though I went to a recently integrated school that had been all-boys only a few years previously.

I'm still seriously considering an engineering or engineering-tech career.  (Surveying?  Yeah, that sounds really appealing.)  But for me personally, overcoming a lot of misogyny, and ugly experiences with harassment, is *still* a personal challenge.  I'm not eager to generalize my experiences to women as a broad category - I'm trans and it was more often ""you can't be a girl because you like STEM"" than ""you can't like STEM because you're a girl"", but whichever way those prejudices slice I have become very much aware of them.  It's *amazing* what chauvinists will say when they think no women are listening.

I honestly feel I have to check myself because I feel a bit resentful towards these guys sometimes. Therefore the request for some perspective cause I don't want to be unfair.

These guys have what I consider some poor work ethics: they can be very dry, borderline rude when responding to questions, are usually late to meetings or don't accept them and don't show up, they take forever to complete their tasks and won't proactively do their work, I have to always be reminding them of their own tasks even though I'm not an engineer.

Sometimes they delay deadlines or reduce the time other non-engineer team members will have to do their work if their work comes after the engineering side. They don't involve me in meetings about the project even tho I'm their boss and apologise then do it again. They gossip and make comments about people not being smart or that managers (all women) do nothing all day. For them to do something you need to praise them and talk about how intelligent they are.

They sometimes comment on videogames they play during work hours and if there's nothing urgent they simply chill and do nothing unless you explicitely ask them. 

The country where I live is pretty good with work laws, so given that they grew up here they might be more chill about work, which is a cultural thing. But I think sometimes they take it too far! 

I'm not so good with engineering yet so I feel sometimes I have to interrogate them to decipher their work, they don't meet me half way in trying to communicate in a non-technical or even just less-technical way. And they somehow expect that I will understand their riddles of code they've been working on for weeks in the 20 min meeting we have to discuss an issue.

I feel a general lack of empathy for the work of others and over emphasis on themselves. I've had other members of my team have to do overtime because some of them took forever to complete their work before a deadline, but during all of that time said they were fine, things were fine and didn't need any help. So I don't get what was the delay about. 

I want to be fair but I have this nagging feeling that they  are spoilt brats and think they are better than others. I feel bad about this tho, because it could also be about my perspective and lack of experience...?

I don't even know why honestly. I'm in limbo.

Background: Several months ago I asked for a promotion and a raise. I am a manager in tech. My responsibilities have drastically increased. I'm being paid significantly under market value. I was told sorry, there's no room in the budget for raises. So I said ok, I hired a career coach who did my resume and LinkedIn and I started applying and networking. Within about 6 weeks I had two interviews with two different companies and I've advanced to the final round of interviews with both.

Job Number 1: Scrum Master role (with additional responsibilities and direct reports). Established and growing software company. Highly rated company culture on Glassdoor and Indeed. Fully remote. 55% pay increase (unsure about PTO). Seems like excellent work-life balance. Final round interview next week.

Job Number 2: Director level position. Start up fiber internet company (I’d be responsible for all the software platforms which would include choosing them). There would be no direct reports for at least 12 months. I'd be wearing multiple hats. It's not my primary skillset but I think they like my personality as well as my accomplishments. Fully remote with some in office presence. 100% increase in pay. Hiring VP did tell me he works nights and weekends so I am concerned about work life balance (my kids are 5 years old and 16 months old).

I'm in final interview rounds with both. Obviously neither job has been offered to me. And it may very well come out there neither job gets offered to me. But I am really torn between the two.

Lastly, I love my boss. She has been a huge mentor for me. She supported me so much through the birth of my second and giving me a lot of leeway when I returned from maternity leave. She gives me a lot of really great feedback and support. She does not control my salary. It's her boss who does and he likes me - but he thinks I'm replaceable (and honestly the irony is they would just have to replace me with someone who will get paid what I should be making). I want to tell my boss so bad. We are really close and I just feel so guilty not telling her and I feel so guilty leaving her with the burden of filing my open role because her boss thinks I can just be replaced. And I'm not saying I can't be, but they could have avoided this by just paying me what I'm worth.

Edit to add: I also love my employees. They are awesome people. I would be really sad to leave them.

Our previous interactions had been casual and friendly, limited to short and to-the-point Slack messages. However, I've noticed a recent uptick in messages from him that carry a condescending tone. While he mentioned to the team that he has OCD and is particular about things, I also have some OCD and can understand the nuances.

He randomly messages me about things I've never been prompted on before in my ten years of professional experience, and messages me out of the blue about how long something is taking, even though I have a consistent track record of delivering features on time. He also keeps track of how many times he has to prompt me about something, such as a nitpick on a design choice made by a previous colleague, which I didn't see as necessary to change. Despite responding to his query in the pull request, he messaged me about it at three separate intervals.

While I understand his good intentions to improve the development process, he hyper-focuses on subjective matters that don't affect delivery. His daily prompts about nonsensical or unnecessary things are frustrating, and I'm unsure why our interactions have shifted from collegial to bordering on belittling. He appears to micromanage how I work, even though I haven't indicated that I need help on the things he prompts me about.

My boss likes and trusts him, so I don't want to involve HR or my boss. However, I'd like to find ways to mitigate these interactions or communicate with him in ways that redirect his focus. It's starting to affect my mental health, and I'm cautious of how I respond to him. I don't want to report every move to appease him or walk on eggshells at work. I was happy with how things were going and don't want these interactions to continue.  


I'm unsure of how to navigate this but I know that I don't want this to continue and I don't want to go to my boss about this (there are nuances about the company that I don't want to share but let's just say they're the same nationality and come from the same culture) because I feel like he's going to take his side and not really be able to hear where I'm coming from without him perceiving me as defensive or frustrated.   


I also don't want to change jobs over this because I love the work that I'm doing and I'm happy with my current situation but I also don't want these interactions to evolve into something more; frankly, I just want to be heads down and do my work and have as little interaction with my team lead as possible.

The brain doesn’t significantly deteriorate until very late in life, or for certain health conditions. Programmers are more than capable of coding well into their 60s, until they are ready to retire.

However, performance in a work environment has as much to do with behavioural skills, and people reskilling into tech a decade or two later have had that much extra time to develop advanced behavioural skills over someone younger. That makes a world of difference in what it’s like to work with someone. 

For example, knowing how to take initiative to see what needs doing and get in and do it rather than kicking back and waiting for someone to tell you what to do (such as waiting around for  PM to assign you work, rather than finding it yourself).

As far as education quality goes… the time it takes to do a 4 yr degree, someone could do a bootcamp plus self learning (all the curriculum of a degree is available free online btw, can learn all the same stuff if you want) , get a job and have a few years professional experience under their belt. You learn way more on the job than in a university. University is slow, academic, and spoon fed compared to working in the industry - and most bootcamp grads know this because they already have a degree  and work experience in another field so they have a good comparison to draw on when making a decision about what is the most efficient way for them to learn these skills. 

University is a very 20th century solution that has failed to keep pace with changes in society that mean degrees are often out to date by the time students graduate and we are forever learning throughout our careers both on the job and self learning. Uni still has a purpose but mostly for either people who want a career in academia/research or people straight out of school who still have some growing up to do before they’ll be ready to enter the professional world.

Bootcamp grads are eager to get started on their career and know they’ll learn more on the job doing the actual work rather than waste time to sitting exams, writing essays, and working on school projects. Taking this route they’ll be mid level software engineer by the time someone who took uni route is getting internships and looking for a graduate position.",2398,testimonial injustice,cherry pick story match beliefs ignore discount story challenge brain significantly deteriorate late life certain health condition programmer capable cod well 60s ready retire however performance work environment much behavioural skill people reskilling tech decade two late much extra time develop advanced behavioural skill someone young make world difference like work someone example know take initiative see need get rather kick back wait someone tell wait around pm assign work rather find far education quality go time take 4 yr degree someone could bootcamp plus self learn curriculum degree available free online btw learn stuff want get job year professional experience belt learn way job university university slow academic spoon fed compare work industry bootcamp grad know already degree work experience another field good comparison draw make decision efficient way learn skill university 20th century solution fail keep pace change society mean degree often date time student graduate forever learn throughout career job self learn uni still purpose mostly either people want career academia research people straight school still grow ready enter professional world bootcamp grad eager get start career know learn job actual work rather waste time sit exam write essay work school project take route mid level software engineer time someone take uni route get internship look graduate position,woman,job,tech,developer,software,0.654267053,devalue,0.04,offensive,0.04,incompetent,0.04,woman,0.651218591,pronoun,0.163647041,excuse,0.075382049,0

Every argument you make can also be said in reverse. There are both horror and success stories for both CS grads and bootcamp grads. 

For example, CS degrees also have a high fail rate, a lot of people who start CS degrees switch to other studies or take a non developer role after graduation. Does that make CS degrees a scam? Does that make CS grads stupid and incompetent? 

Whatever path people take, some will succeed, will fail.

How you account the value of a CS degree is very subjective. 

What does a person achieve in 4.25 years if they succeed in their career goal to be a developer?

- CS student spends 4 yrs at uni, followed by job 3 months search, to get an entry level job either grad program, junior or associate level.

- bootcamp grad spends 3-12 months at a bootcamp and self study, followed by 6 months job search, to get an entry level job either grad program, junior or associate level, gets several years of experience and a promotion to mid level.

And what does it look like if someone fails, whether because they aren’t good enough or decide they don’t like it?

- CS student may fail or drop out or switch at any point in time in the 4 year degree OR may be a good “student” and do well at uni from a grades perspective (or may cheat to get foot grades) and only realise 4.25yrs later when they have a job that they actually hate it or may struggle to get a job as a developer and take something easier.

- bootcamp student will find out pretty quick if this path isn’t for them, either in the bootcamp, the job hunt, or their first job - can end up in any of the same places as the CS student but learns this lesson faster.

Neither bootcamp nor CS degree are capable of teaching “everything”. 

Bootcamp is training specifically developing the skills needed for an entry level job in the industry; and then you learn more on the job and through ongoing professional development.

CS degrees are more theoretical and generalised. They teach a little bit of a lot of different topics, of which only a small proportion will end up being relevant to your career. They don’t teach all the skills needed for specific roles (that bootcamps focus on). Graduates are still going to have to learn a lot on the job and throughout their career.

As far as behavioural skills go, do a little research. It doesn’t matter if you hire smart talented knowledgeable people if they are incapable of working well together. We work as teams in organisations and everything we do requires good communication, organisation, team work… (behavioural skills). There is a world of difference between working with people with a good attitude and toxic personalities. Coding is only a fraction of the job, and will be hampered if there is bad communication, disorganisation and behaviour.

As far as “meeting smart people”… lol. Already have plenty of smart people in my life and work, and you can meet new people by networking at industry events, groups and conferences - no need to go to go back to uni and hang out with students.",3088,testimonial injustice,cherry pick every argument make also say reverse horror success story cs grad bootcamp grad example c degree also high fail rate lot people start cs degree switch study take non developer role graduation make c degree scam make cs grad stupid incompetent whatever path people take succeed fail account value cs degree subjective person achieve 4 25 year succeed career goal developer c student spend 4 yr uni follow job 3 month search get entry level job either grad program junior associate level bootcamp grad spend 3 12 month bootcamp self study follow 6 month job search get entry level job either grad program junior associate level get several year experience promotion mid level look like someone fail whether good enough decide like cs student may fail drop switch point time 4 year degree may good student well uni grade perspective may cheat get foot grade realise 4 25yrs late job actually hate may struggle get job developer take something easy bootcamp student find pretty quick path either bootcamp job hunt first job end place cs student learns lesson fast neither bootcamp c degree capable teach everything bootcamp train specifically develop skill need entry level job industry learn job ongoing professional development c degree theoretical generalise teach little bit lot different topic small proportion end relevant career teach skill need specific role bootcamps focus graduate still go learn lot job throughout career far behavioural skill go little research matter hire smart talented knowledgeable people incapable work well together work team organisation everything require good communication organisation team work behavioural skill world difference work people good attitude toxic personality cod fraction job hamper bad communication disorganisation behaviour far meet smart people lol already plenty smart people life work meet new people network industry event group conference need go go back uni hang student,woman,job,tech,developer,software,0.654267053,incapable,0.336511863,incompetent,0.281424984,devalue,0.016611441,woman,0.727870524,award,0.134972576,excuse,0.056697028,0

I am a gay female engineer with ADHD in a male dominated company where the majority of the other engineers are white males aged anywhere from 55-75. I am also an engineering manager. I expect downvotes but I just have to say this.

  
I mostly am responding because the way you're phrasing your complaints about the feedback on your work process is coming across as a problem to me. Reading your original post and also many of your replies, I am getting this mindset from you: ""I have ADHD and so I work in this specific way and any feedback about it is an attack, and I shouldn't have to change or even consider it because this is JUST THE WAY I AM"".  


It sounds like you think the way you work is perfect and are absolutely unwilling to work on it, and are offended they'd even talk about it because it's your 'disability', even if it means you're causing problems on your team. Well, this just isn't realistic. I have pretty severe ADHD that comes with a heavy dose of Executive Disfunction. I can say with 100% confidence that if I told my boss that I can't wake up before 11AM, and then I can't make myself work unless I am suddenly inspired for a couple hours once in a while, and that meetings are complete gibberish that I cannot force myself to pay attention to, and that I am going to spend 8 hours developing a feature that no one asked for because it seemed interesting to me and I went down a rabbit hole, etc etc... I would no longer be employed.   


These are things I struggle with daily, and they do not fit in with a job that expects specific results. I am also an extreme introvert and hosting a dozen O3 meetings per week is a massive emotional and psychological challenge for me, but I am working my ass off to improve them. I am taking medication, setting alarms, writing myself notes, reading books about interpersonal communications, and doing everything I can to fit into the role I decided I wanted.   


If I walked into my annual review and my boss said that I have trouble completing tasks, or I am not responsive early mornings, or my employees are complaining about our meetings -- I wouldn't be annoyed and accuse him of diagnosing me. I would either figure out more ways to adapt to the job, or I would find a job that fit me better if that were impossible. Maybe self employment. I have left jobs before that didn't give the flexibility I needed, and have found that one of the things I need to succeed is flex-time, because sometimes I am literally incapable of working.  


You simply cannot show up to a job every day and treat people abrasively/poorly, then do whatever you want because that's your ""process"" and it works for you, and expect a sunshine and roses response. That's the ""Rockstar"" developer mindset, and I absolutely hate it. No one is so great that they don't have to try to work well within the team. I wouldn't accept this from my coworkers or my employees, regardless of their gender.

I have complicated feelings around women in tech groups. On the one hand, these spaces are one of the most comfortable places for me. I'm the only woman on my team of like 9, and one of 2 in our wider org of like 40. 

Gender is weird and complex, and I don't really feel like I fit in anywhere exactly. Men are really frustrating and annoying, and it freaks me out to think people might lump me into the same category as them. But also, I transitioned at 21 years old (3 years ago), and I don't feel like I've had a very typical ""female"" upbringing. I don't think my background really fits into either side of the gender binary.

If you're not super familiar with trans women's experiences: I don't really feel like I ever experience male privilege in the same way that cis men do, and I don't think I ever could. Navigating the world prior to 3 years ago felt more like a scene from the movie ""She's the man"" then anything else. Like I was basically forced to perform masculinity to avoid discrimination. And seeing men from that side has honestly made me a bit of a misandrist probably.

On the flip side, it's hard for me to tell what's my co-workers being sexist, and what's just the result of being early in my career. It feels like I'm constantly interrupted and talked over. It feels like I have to defend my views twice as hard. It feels like I'm never taken seriously, and I feel a lot of pressure to just be quiet honestly. I constantly feel like I have to balance my ""femininity"" with actually doing my job. It feels like I have to choose between being a leader/engineer and being a girl/woman. Like, that maybe if I was cis woman, I could have both. I might be labeled as ""bossy"", but it feels like as a trans woman, my status as a woman is up for debate, and can be revoked at any time. And the alternative isn't that I would be given the male privilege that men get. No instead, I'd just kind of be neither man nor woman.

My co-workers often invite me to women in tech events and groups. And I usually go. I've sought out a few on my own. But I feel terrified that someone there would take an issue with it, not feel comfortable with me there, or just kind of silently judge me.

Nobody's ever really acknowledged the fact that I'm trans at work. It makes me feel like everyone's too afraid to speak their mind. So I never really know if people are chill or silently judging me. I see so much media coverage about transphobia, it's hard for me to believe that people don't think all sorts of weird things about me. And I don't really have anything to say about it usually other than ""Are you chill with me?"" which just feels like it isn't okay to ask, nor would it get a proper response lol

Part of me wonders if people even know. A male co-worker of mine had a conversation about it recently and he said ""I didn't know until you said something."" And we'd known each other for a while at that point. It was in the context of him telling me he was bi though so I also wonder if he was just hitting on me.

I guess I just feel like I was never ""given permission"" to be a woman? Like I was told that if I wanted to transition that I had to BE a woman. And I don't really know what that means to be honest. There are clearly a lot of people who insist that I'm not, and there are also people who insist that I am. I'd rather be a woman than not, because I feel like there just wouldn't really be a place for me otherwise. Like ""female"" is the closer fit of the two options, and I'm not really interested in trying to carve out a new identity/group that poeple don't accept or understand. It feels like a lot of my rights are on the line too. Like my status as a woman determines whether or not I have a safe/comfortable bathroom. It determines whether or not I'll have access to certain types of medical care like hormones. And it also seems to determine how accepted I am by the people I relate to the most.

I don't know, sorry if that was rambling. What do y'all think of trans women in women's spaces? Especially in tech. Do you have any advice? I'd really like to understand better how other people are perceiving me, and I don't know how to make other's comfortable opening up to me about their perspective/experience with trans people.",4294,testimonial injustice,hi trans woman work tech complicate feeling around woman tech group one hand space one comfortable place woman team like 9 one 2 wider org like 40 gender weird complex really feel like fit anywhere exactly men really frustrate annoy freaks think people might lump category also transition 21 year old 3 year ago feel like typical female upbringing think background really fit either side gender binary super familiar trans woman experience really feel like ever experience male privilege way cis men think ever could navigate world prior 3 year ago felt like scene movie man anything else like basically force perform masculinity avoid discrimination see men side honestly make bit misandrist probably flip side hard tell co worker sexist result early career feel like constantly interrupt talked feel like defend view twice hard feel like never take seriously feel lot pressure quiet honestly constantly feel like balance femininity actually job feel like choose leader engineer girl woman like maybe cis woman could might label bossy feel like trans woman status woman debate revoke time alternative would give male privilege men get instead kind neither man woman co worker often invite woman tech event group usually go sought feel terrify someone would take issue feel comfortable kind silently judge nobody ever really acknowledge fact trans work make feel like everyone afraid speak mind never really know people chill silently judge see much medium coverage transphobia hard believe people think sort weird thing really anything say usually chill feel like okay ask would get proper response lol part wonder people even know male co worker mine conversation recently say know say something know point context tell bi though also wonder hit guess feel like never give permission woman like tell want transition woman really know mean honest clearly lot people insist also people insist rather woman feel like really place otherwise like female close fit two option really interested try carve new identity group poeple accept understand feel like lot right line like status woman determine whether safe comfortable bathroom determine whether access certain type medical care like hormone also seem determine accept people relate know sorry ramble think trans woman woman space especially tech advice really like understand good people perceive know make comfortable open perspective experience trans people,woman,job,tech,developer,software,0.73465672,bossy,0.52,devalue,0.02,offensive,0.02,woman,0.837537579,excuse,0.080969607,nurse,0.00452739,1

I am at the end of a Computer Science bachelor's programme and will look for a job after I finished it.

I have been doing some jobs while I was a student and I learned to program a bit during my studies. However, I never program for fun or have a lot of experience. The truth is that I just did these studies to get a secure, well-paid job and not because I am passionate about it.

I should also mention that I am a bit older than most people would be at this point: 32.

Despite those student jobs that were in programming, I feel like I know very little and am not really proficient in any programming language. I regret not having worked for longer during my studies.

Now that I will be looking for my first real job, I feel pretty inadequate. In student jobs, the employers and colleagues probably expect less, and if it is only because you earn less.

I feel like if I should apply for a specific, real job, I would like it to start in a couple of months so I have time to get into the programming language, required tools, etc. And I feel like I should ask for a relatively low salary so people don't expect as much from me.

I know, however, that you should always sell yourself as best as you can and not show any insecurity. It is classic imposter syndrome, I guess.

From a financial point of view, my plan (starting a little later and ""practicing"" first) would work.

Is it a good idea to do it like this?

Or should I just ""go for it"" and risk sucking at my first job and getting fired after a while?I feel like that would mess with my self-esteem even more.

Although this may sound counterintuitive, I think women in our area, in general, are considered more competent than our male counterparts which result in higher expectations being placed on us by our superiors (male/female).

This bias of 'if a woman has gotten this far is CS she must be pretty special/amazing' is held by both male and female supervisors. Which is a shame! As it means mediocre men get a free pass when it comes to most work whereas we're expected to live up to impossible standards placed on us by being a minority that has gotten far. 

However, as with your situation, I think female supervisors might be more guilty than male when it comes to holding these expectations.

I just need to get it out I guess. I don’t love working, very few people do, but I like my job enough. It’s challenging without being overwhelming, the things we build are relatively meaningful, I’m fully remote and have a lot of flexibility with how I structure my day, and for the most part I’m treated like a human, except for when I end up speaking with my boss’s boss about pretty much anything related to actual work during our one on ones, which are thankfully only monthly.

She brought up that she’d be pulling me out of a weekly meeting for a project that I am on but only do a little bit of work for, which is fine but I expressed that I’ll miss being in the meeting because we’re all remote and geographically distant and it’s nice to hear from people and feel like I’m on an actual team versus just working alone in a room all day (we don’t do stand ups or anything and my position is not client facing at all, so my time spent talking to people is otherwise pretty limited.) I have one other weekly project meeting I’ll still be on but having two was nice. For context these meetings are roughly an hour long, usually shorter.

And then I fucked up by also saying that it was nice to have an “easy billable hour” and oh boy did that send her. She let me go on a bit about how the work I do is mentally taxing and having that hour back won’t really make a difference in what I get done in a given week because there is just a finite limit to what I can reasonably, meaningfully produce before I start making mistakes/outputting garbage and then she went on this spiel about how “we don’t have the budget on the project for that” (this is honestly laughable considering the tiny percentage of the project budget one hour a week comprises, but sure that’s fine) and “the meeting isn’t always billable to the client if you don’t have that many items“ and “your annual billable hours goal isn’t unreasonable, you only need to bill 32 hours a week” which is actually untrue, when you factor in days off and PTO I need to reach 35 billable hours a week, which is honestly insane considering most meetings are not billable, training/getting up to speed on components/projects or training other people on components/projects is not supposed to be billed (and even the most experienced people at the company need to do this because our product has so many moving parts, it’s common to forget entirely how some of them work if you don’t look at them for a while), and we have ongoing training both company wide and developer specific that we are supposed to complete, plus about a billion company wide emails and initiatives to deal with and sort through almost daily.

All pertinent information which I stupidly pushed back with, only for her to deliver the cherry on top, “other people don’t have any issues reaching these goals,” “it’s just the company expectation,” and “you know, baconbrand, you consistently log 40 hours a week, a lot of people work 43-45 hours. It’s totally fine that you do that as long as we can all be honest and understanding that it’s going to hinder your advancement at the company.” Cool cool cool, good to know that everything is fine and reasonable and I’m just actually an idiot who isn’t even cut out for this job. (For the record there are only two other devs under her, one is my boss who has a lower billable hours goal as a manager, and is just more comfortable than me about padding his hours, and the other is the same title as me and he also has trouble reaching his billable goal every year, but let’s just ignore that to tell me I’m the idiot outlier I guess. The other people under her are not developers and attend way more meetings.)

So great to hear that being more efficient and effective my job isn’t what’s going to get me level changes, no, it’s those magical extra 3 to 5 hours a week?? UNPAID extra hours, as we are all salary???

Also, level changes and promotions do not come with a raise at my job. So I don’t understand why I’m supposed to care about them at all. I don’t want more responsibility for the same pay.

Anyway it’s just frustrating and for some reason worse coming from another woman. Like this person who’s been management for 20+ years literally still sees people as actual robots where hours in = productivity out. She doesn’t see what I see, which are the loads and loads of tech debt from this mindset that make it take way longer than it should to get stuff done. She doesn’t care if I’m tired and inefficient. She doesn’t want to see and so she doesn’t see all the rework our team ends up doing during “crunch” periods that have no reason to be crunchy at all, but are because she’s a bad manager who thinks that crunching is normal and even noble. She knows for a fact that if I burn out, it’s a reflection on me as an individual who just couldn’t cut it (in the most boring, uncompetitive corner of CRUD development in the world; this isn’t startup or FAANG level shit here) and not an issue with management or the company.

So yeah idk. I’d look for a new job but at this point in my career I know that every job comes with a certain flavor of unfathomably deep bullshit and it’s just a matter of deciding what bullshit I can stomach.

With COVID, everyone in my cohort was laid off except for me and one other person :( I was switched around to 4 different teams in my 2 years there and never got the chance to feel comfortable in any one area of our tech stack. My title was Associate Software Engineer at both companies.

After moving back home and over a year in therapy, I'm feeling more stable and ready to return to work. I technically have 3 years of industry experience, but I still feel very junior/associate level! I've started to read up on data structures/algorithms on Geeksforgeeks, attempt Leetcode easy problems, and follow a MERN stack tutorial (my previous experience was with Ruby on Rails). I know that it'll take me several months to get back to up speed and I'm trying to trust the process. However, I started imagining what would happen if I actually got a job as a software engineer, and realized I'm really, really dreading it.  All the fears of imposter syndrome, little moments of sexism, and making friends only to have them get laid off came flooding back 😥

I used to be very mission-driven, but now just generally feel incompetent and uninspired by coding. I'm not sure if this is the path for me, or if I should try going back to school or do a bootcamp or something. Should I just find work at a larger, more stable company? Does software engineering just feel like a grind until you actually get better at it?

I decided on CS for financial stability and the flexibility of being able to work in different industries. I thought I could do it as long as I was working with good people--I loved being part of the DEI and sustainability committees at my last job, and planning social events for my team (although maybe this contributed to burnout). I thought about leaving tech to be a teacher or a therapist, and have an interest in biology as well, but feel like it would be a waste of my CS degree. Has anyone here made a move to adjacent positions that are less coding focused, and maybe more people focused? How did you make that decision, and what experiences clued you in on it?

I’ve been sort of lurking around this sub for a little while, and I was hoping to get some advice/encouragement?

I’m a senior in CS at a good public uni, and next semester is my last one. However, over the last four years I’ve noticed that my feelings of being an imposter have grown steadily worse, and it may have affected my grades. I have a terrible GPA (~2.5), and I have to get at least a C++ average in the rest of my major classes in order to graduate. In other words, I am the living embodiment of “ C’s get degrees”.  I’ve done an internship at a fairly well known company, and I work part time on campus doing web development, but I haven’t really done any side projects. Whenever I come close to doing non-class coding I get this overwhelming fear that my code is/is going to be terrible and not optimized well enough and just *mediocre*. That I am mediocre, and that I won’t be able to get a job. Then that just starts me down a dark hole of self-pity and worry about being able to pay off my student loans, and so on and so forth.  The only classes that I consistently get A’s and B’s in are my classes for my English minor, so I’m worried that I wasted money and time pursuing a CS degree despite my love of coding and problem solving. 

At work I feel completely incompetent the majority of the time. Despite being the senior employee, my boss gives all of the ‘interesting’ or ‘challenging’ projects to my male coworker, and the few times that I was able to take the more difficult assignments, they were all cancelled or used to goad another department into doing their jobs and then cancelled. Over the course of three or so years there I’ve essentially only done bug fixes and refactoring that was almost immediately refactored by my male coworker again. It just feels like nothing that I do is good enough, nor appreciated, and that just further fuels my certainty that I am incompetent and that my code is terrible.  To make matters worse, I feel like whenever I walk into work I become noticeably dumber or something. At the moment it seems like my biggest completed project will be establishing and writing all of the documentation for a web app that has been in active deployment/development for more than 6 years.

Has anyone else had this experience? Any advice for how to deal with these problems and what to look for in post-grad positions?

After talking to the manager, it sounds like I’ll be exposed to a lot more things than what the job description listed. Like, instead of a purely React developer, I’ll be working with tools like Google Cloud Platform, Salesforce, Tag Manager, web scraping, stuff like that. So things that are related to web development, but not fully front end work.

When I started my job search, I thought I wanted 100% React, but this role is really intriguing me.

The company is a marketing agency, something I’ve been wanting to try out. They are transitioning their digital department from contractors to full-time, and I’ll be one of the first full-time people on the team. The manager and I really connected, and the people I’ve met are really kind and down to earth. They seem super happy. Their clients are made up of a specific industry that I care about, and I would love exposure to. As time goes on, seems like there’s potential for this role to turn into a management role, which is also something that has interested me.

And honestly? I’ve been writing code for some time now. It might be interesting to branch out and learn some new skills that aren’t code-specific.

My heart is fully set on this role, but I’m hesitating. Am I wearing rose colored glasses? I just quit a job last week (after less than two months) where the manager kept implying I didn’t know my field. He kept insinuating I catfished him in the interview process. It has fucked with my confidence. What if I’m running away from a pure front end developer role because he got in my head that I’m incompetent? What if I take this role and it’s not what I made it out to be? How will this affect my career going forward, if I spend less time developing in, like, React?

Oh, and then there’s salary. This salary is the same as my current role. It’s already good money, but I’m getting other interviews with a $40k+ raise. I really don’t need this extra money, but I feel a lot of guilt taking a job that pays less than other opportunities. Those roles also don’t interest me like this one.  Those would very much feel like just a paycheck, and I don’t think I would be challenged. Those roles are also at start ups and I don’t think I want to work in that environment. This new place has been around for a VERY long time.

This feels like it could be SO much different than the jobs I’ve had in the past, but there’s a little voice in my head saying “maybe that’s not a bad thing.” Do I trust my gut?",2561,testimonial injustice,apply front end developer role talk manager sound like expose lot thing job description list like instead purely react developer work tool like google cloud platform salesforce tag manager web scrap stuff like thing relate web development fully front end work start job search think want 100 react role really intriguing company marketing agency something want try transition digital department contractor full time one first full time people team manager really connect people meet really kind earth seem super happy client make specific industry care would love exposure time go seem like potential role turn management role also something interested honestly write code time might interest branch learn new skill code specific heart fully set role hesitate wear rise colored glass quit job last week less two month manager keep imply know field keep insinuate catfished interview process fuck confidence run away pure front end developer role get head incompetent take role make affect career go forward spend less time develop like react oh salary salary current role already good money get interview 40k raise really need extra money feel lot guilt take job pay less opportunity role also interest like one would much feel like paycheck think would challenge role also start ups think want work environment new place around long time feel like could much different job past little voice head say maybe bad thing trust gut,woman,job,tech,developer,software,0.754406886,dismissive,0.383303306,incompetent,0.227776013,devalue,0.016909595,woman,0.721092405,pattern,0.101140829,excuse,0.089273257,0

Last week, I had a mini melt down after being put on a new project, new timezone, new teammates, and unfamiliar tech stack. My manager encouraged me to pick up some tickets and contribute. I did the easy bug fixes ok but then I got to the meaty dev ticket. I felt overwhelmed again. This is a familiar feeling. It's like brain fog and I crumble under stress. I don't know if I'm cut out for software development since the whole premise is to problem solve and handle ambiguity. I can't do either of those well. I've always battled with anxiety and just constant fear of judgment and critique which gets in the way of communicating, especially asking questions in a timely manner. I've forgotten to eat and shower again, haven't had my period in months (though that might be related to PCOS). This is a negative cycle that is very familiar to me and has been the culprit (I suspect) of not getting return offers from my past tech internships. I get a knot at the pit of my stomach every time I go to stand up because I haven't been productive in days and the team is obviously unhappy with my lack of performance and initiative. Overall, the team has been stressed as well since they have a new release coming but at least they're still being productive. I've been sleeping for 3-4 hours every night just dreading to go to work which is my fault because I can't seem to fall asleep since my brain is thinking of what dumb stuff I will say/do tomorrow. I just can't be productive with this mindset. Sorry for the rant.

Recently I've sought out help for my mental health for the first time in my life and it helps somewhat, got recommended to get tested for adhd and chronic depression. I know I can overcome this, but maybe I need medications to help me because my negative thought patterns are very persistent even after therapy and I just can't find the motivation to physically take care of myself anymore.   


But in the meantime, to pay the bills, I'm thinking of going for a government job for about 6 months until I get my mental health in order. Has anyone done taken a brief career halt to get their mental health in order in order to be their best self? What would I say to future employers about leaving my first job so early?

I'm feeling major imposter syndrome. I know it's normal and all SWEs get it but I just have to vent somewhere and just want to hear what you would do?

Context: The startup is really small (20\~ people at this point) and the eng team is probably a team of 5? It will be a fullstack role but for now I will primarily be responsible for the backend (there's only 1 other eng doing this and the rest focus elsewhere). I had originally hoped that my first role would be at a more established company where there's some sort of training program and some mentorship but the reality is those companies have a lot of leetcode style assessments/technical interviews and I just don't do that well on them. I just don't think it's a very fair assessment of your ability to create fullstack apps. That's a whole other point though so I digress.

My biggest fear is that since they are so small (and my team especially), I will have a lot of responsibilities as a founding engineer that could become too overwhelming with someone at my level of experience. With no prior professional experience in engineering, I am really anxious about how it's going to look if I can't figure out how to create features or if I am just not able to keep up in general. Given that they're a startup, I'm sure if I'm not performing to their standards and expectations, I will be let go cause they don't have the runway to keep a useless engineer. I can already tell I'll have to put in a lot of OT and that's honestly fine with me but it seems like weekends aren't necessarily off limits. I get it, it's a startup, all hands on deck especially during a product launch but it scares me a bit. I just have a somewhat fragile mental state where I tend to catastrophisize everything and I worry that this kind of a role will drive me to the brink. I can tell the company is just figuring things out as they go cause the founders are pretty young and inexperienced as well. Pay is very average... if it were better, it  wouldve made the OT less of an issue but at the same time learning is the most valuable thing I can do right now.

On the flip side, there's major room for growth into any kind of role you want in the future and if they do really well and continue to scale, I am on the fast track for management. I also luckily have experience with their tech stack and there's no better way to learn than by doing. The market is also really tough right now and to continue interviewing would feel brutal since I'm not great at leetcode style questions. Mostly everyone says I'm lucky to have landed this role and to do it.

The “sorry you had to deal with that” is so obligatory but so sincere here, fuuuuck all of it.

I’m white and I have zero good advice. Honestly at this point I’ve just learned to care less about work and more about other shit like my friends, my family, and my hobbies. Being personable and knowing how to make eye contact will go a long way in getting you hired and most of us have an advantage there so I guess there’s that, but once you’re hired good luck with promotions. At this point it’s fine because the money is good and the stress is low but it’s an entirely different beast for those who are more ambitious.

I don’t want to fight tooth and nail for a more managerial role but I don’t want to end up as an unemployed useless IC 4 life either aaaaaaahhhhhh

One regret I do have is not being louder. This is hard and extremely more hard because of course you risk the “angry black woman” label. Ew ew ew and more ew. But idk if I had spoken up in more meetings and for example just calmly stated “that is exactly what I just said but worded differently” that would have just been so great and felt so great. You have to cultivate this massive zen and self awareness and ability to not flip a table (v much not my strong suit) and idk if at college age I would have been able to do it. Now I’m pushing thirty and everything is just so much easier as far as that and I still have a long way to go even.

I don’t know where you are geographically but I went to college in Atlanta and I was the only white lady to four or five ladies of color in my classes and there was certainly no shortage of black men so idk maybe Atlanta in general is a better environment for being a minority and in tech. Or, more likely, they found the field insufferable and went and did something different. This is depressing but extremely valid. I’ve heard too many stories along those lines too. But yeah if you’re up for relocation maybe check it out? Cons: a car and traffic forever Pros: black people actually being allowed to succeed at business shit

Just a lot of targeted speculation. The reason why she refuses to talk about that is since it entertains the theory that there's a man behind all her work. And being on the defensive about trying to prove your work is your own is pretty exhausting. The CEO of Maker Media even said ""Naomi is a persona, not a real person. She is several or many people."" and eventually apologized but you can see why this is something she doesn't want to deal with. Also, there's also an additional entire cultural context to this situation from how the Chinese government treats women's rights.
 
From her twitter, it shows that she was firm with what she wanted and did not want in an interview. In the VICE article itself, the author wrote ""Wu told me she didn’t want to discuss her marital status, but before publishing the piece, I followed up with her. "" Which is pretty disrespectful since the author intentionally went over boundaries to discuss some conspiracy theories Naomi explicitly didn't want to deal with. 

She intentionally hides a lot of personal information about herself for privacy and safety reasons (she gets harassed and threatened a lot). She also said that VICE included some of her personal information in their media which would make it possible to dox her. This is a huge no-no considering she's in a country that doesn't have the same privileges that many first-world countries do. For example, the #MeToo hashtag is censored by the government and chinese feminists use a ""hidden"" way to express that through emojis. China is a extremely patriarchal country *(see Confucianism)* and a lot of fighting against that sort of culture can get you branded as a traitor to the country for colluding with foreigners. 

That's when the Naomi started calling out VICE on twitter since they were no longer responding to her emails. So I believe Naomi shared someone's address and then Patreon deleted her account for doxing. So now her source of income for creating content is also gone. Other methods of payment for content is generally a no-no since most payment systems require verification of identity. No to both cryptocurrency and legal remedies since she's in China.  As of now it looks like she's gonna stop for a while til things get sorted out. 

I would agree that the article is pretty light I would say but disregarding Naomi's preferences and revealing more personal information than what Naomi is comfortable is the issue. Furthermore, not responding to her communications just exacerbated the situation. It was wrong of her to release someone's address but my personal interpretation is that I think VICE really fucked up here.

My college hooked me up with this interview, believe it or not.  It was the weirdest interview I've ever had.  It was with this small local IT business - there was a web page, but pretty old - I think it was last updated in 2014 or 2015 if memory serves.  But, it looked plausible.  And, I'm going to community college, so these types of jobs are probably as good as it gets at first.  The email said they were looking for an intern/junior developer resource to assist with a client project.  That they'd designed a custom web-based solution for a customer using PHP and MySQL and they thought it would be a great hands-on opportunity that could lead to additional opportunities.

Anyway, we met at a local coffee shop.  Over the course of the interview, there were a bunch of holes in the story and the story shifted.  It became a plugin they needed help working on.  Then it was a plugin the customer had purchased and customized and needed help.  Oh, and by the way, it was injected with malicious code or something?  I'm not really sure at this point what it was.  (Later, through research, I discovered it could be a malicious plugin that infects wordpress sites?  This is judging by the name that was stated of the plugin, anyway.  Though, all of this could be fiction.)

Then, he made a comment about how difficult this PHP is, especially without a debugger...  (It was stated as if he thought it's not possible to have one when working with PHP??  That is not true.)  And, something else he said made me think he didn't know how to set up his development environment or didn't bother.  He seemed amazed I have XAMPP installed and configured, which was just weird.  Why would he even be talking to me if he would be amazed by that.  He even had me spell it.  Ugh.

This wasn't sounding like the job opportunity stated in the email.  And it was all just...  off.

So, I googled the guy's name and turns out he's a sex offender.  I discovered old news stories about how he'd been charged with many counts of kidnapping and rape a little more than a decade ago. I also found him on the sex offender registry. He was convicted and released in 2011. It's definitely him.

Anyway...  My question...  Ladies, what's your opinion about having your picture on your developer portfolio page?

I am beginning to think the entire reason I ended up having a breakfast ""interview"" with this guy is because he saw my picture.  It was a head shot of me on my bike, with my bike helmet on and sunglasses.  It was just the theme I put together using a couple photos from when I was out on the local bike trail during the summer. When I put it together, it was my final project for my client-side development class. (We could choose whatever we wanted for our final project, we just had to meet certain requirements.

girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:12,2023-04-15 19:02,Elsavoy,Post,Stay one more month for equity or go?,12nm428,,"I (29F, 7YOE) have been having a very bad time in the latest 1.5 months of work. I got COVID, felt kinda foggy minded for a while, got very work anxious because of not being able to focus well and tried to compensate for this by working over time a lot. I pretty much burned out and ended up also making some stupid mistakes (not anything huge but the mistakes ended up costing me time)

Despite loads of overtime, I still failed to deliver my project on time and what was originally estimated  (not by me though, I originally estimated it as min 4 weeks) as a 2 weeks project ended up taking 7 weeks. 

My manager (45M) complained of this, told me I wasn't transparent enough with my delays and that my velocity is not up to the standards and that he will have to take action unless I improve. I wasn't officially put on PIP though and my latest review before latest 1.5 months was good (3 months ago). 

I don't have any real arguments against his complaints, I'm not sure what to tell him since it is technically true, I didn't announce the moment every single unexpected tiny unexpected thing popped up, I just said during dailies ""this will take longer than estimated because of x"", but I didn't give an exact date of when it will be done. Rest of my team (3 M)   doesn't do this either when delays happen, but the vibe coming from my manager is ""no one had this big of a delay"". 

To cut the story short, I decided to quit, I feel really bad because of the mistakes I made and I don't know if there's a way to get the respect of my team back and I hate that even the most junior person I have extensively mentored is now treating me as a noob because of the delayed project. I also just dread work lately and can't seem to find my way back to this job being enjoyable. The reason why I'm postponing quitting is that I have some equity which should be vested in 1 month. 

The rational part of me is telling me to just stay for one more month but I feel like this will just erode my confidence more and make me less confident for upcoming interviews ( I also don't desperately need the money). I'm really in kind of a bad headspace now and don't know how to act at work anymore . My manager and I are discussing actionable plans on how to make sure transparency is embedded in every one of my projects, but my heart is not in it anymore and all conversations feel blaming (maybe I'm overly sensitive? IDK anymore)

 I just can't bring myself to give a fuck and I also can't help coming back to the feeling that I'm maybe not cut out for this field. During my 7 years as an engineer, 90% of the times, I've been in teams where I was always the only woman and I always felt out of place. I'm not saying this is the reason why my performance is bad but it takes a toll on you to always be the odd one out and I'm just tired of feeling like this all the time. The only time when I really thrieved was this golden 9 months period when I had a female manager, who was also an awesome engineer. 

 Sorry for whining. What would you do in my place, power through for one more month? TL, DR: bad performance, 1 month until equity, but very anxious and confidence is shot, should I stay (for one more month)  or should I go ?",3220,testimonial injustice,29f 7yoe bad time late 1 5 month work get covid felt kinda foggy mind get work anxious able focus well tried compensate work time lot pretty much burn end also make stupid mistake anything huge mistake end cost time despite load overtime still fail deliver project time originally estimate though originally estimate min 4 week 2 week project end take 7 week manager 45m complain tell transparent enough delays velocity standard take action unless improve officially put pip though late review late 1 5 month good 3 month ago real argument complaint sure tell since technically true announce moment every single unexpected tiny unexpected thing pop say daily take long estimate x give exact date do rest team 3 either delay happen vibe coming manager one big delay cut story short decide quit feel really bad mistake make know way get respect team back hate even junior person extensively mentor treat noob delay project also dread work lately seem find way back job enjoyable reason postpone quit equity vest 1 month rational part tell stay one month feel like erode confidence make less confident upcoming interview also desperately need money really kind bad headspace know act work anymore manager discuss actionable plan make sure transparency embed every one project heart anymore conversation feel blame maybe overly sensitive idk anymore bring give fuck also help come back feel maybe cut field 7 year engineer 90 time teams always woman always felt place say reason performance bad take toll always odd one tired feel like time time really thrieved golden 9 month period female manager also awesome engineer sorry whine would place power one month tl dr bad performance 1 month equity anxious confidence shot stay one month go,woman,job,tech,developer,software,0.69211909,devalue,0.04,offensive,0.04,incompetent,0.04,woman,0.61967453,clueless,0.245390041,excuse,0.062535973,1
girlsgonewired,new,2023-10-24 20:01,2023-04-30 9:45,confused_xyah,Comment,CS degree?,jiayvaq,,"Well, here's my experience from a graduated SWE! I initially did not intend to enter the tech world but I was a very maths/physics enthusiast. A family member of mine recommended CS for me since it is very high in demand and it aligns with my interests. So I did it, I got accepted and my journey began. 

I'll tell you this from my experience, its not an easy field but it definitely is enjoyable and worth it if you like it and at least have some interest in it. In college, they'll give you the basics, the foundations and its up to YOU to expand more on your knowledge and to learn concepts on your own. There's definitely aloottt of searching and learning on your own. As for the maths, you'll need to be decent at it ofc, but since you mentioned that you have frontend in mind, I wouldn't worry too much about it. 

Tips/advice I'd give if you're set on pursuing CS:

1. Start early. As in start coding and developing projects to build up your skills. Start off slow and put what you learn into good use. It doesn't have to be anything major. But just code.

2. Practice practice practice! I can't empathize this enough. You'll not be good if you just understand the concepts and do one project/ assignment and that's it. You have to try and tinker with them. Maybe search up a different way to do a certain task or maybe you want to add another feature that came to mind. That way you'll fall in love more and more in programming and have faith in yourself that you could DO IT!

3. Google. Omg I always say that to be a good swe you have to be a good googler. Alot of my classmates struggled with that and I was honestly surprised that alot of people can't correctly search/ lookup what they need. Simple things such as debugging, looking up errors and basic things you'd find in docs! So yeah, Google is your best friend if you learn how to truly utilize it.

3. Establish a good connection with your professors and classmates. You could learn and save sooo much time and trial and error if you seek advice from your profs. They hold so much knowledge and you'd be surprised that alot of them love to help out and appreciate students reaching out. Or at least the good profs. you'll have the rude ones, those you need to avoid at all costs lol. As for classmates, sometimes you just need a friend to explain a topic to you that you can't understand from a teacher at all. Idk what it is, but I think its because we mostly think similarly and our thought process aligns. 

Lastly, but thats more of a heads up and to reference what I mentioned at the start, learning does not stop after you graduate and ESPECIALLY in tech. You'll always have to learn, look things up, build fun side projects. So due to that, you may sometimes feel like you're lacking behind or you're not understanding things quickly enough or God forbid, the imposter syndrome. But its all part of the process and I'd like to think of it as a rising cycle. You struggle, you learn, you get good and then you repeat the same thing for another technology/ language or whatever it is lol. 

Those few tips are what stood out to me from my journey and would love to give to myself as advice if I had to start over. I wish you all the best with everything and feel free to contact me and ask me about anything you'd like 😊

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:40,2019-10-25 18:10,womenintecheastcoast,Post,Women in Tech East Coast 2019 conference review: mediocre at best.,dn4opy,,"I just got back from the Women in Tech East Coast 2019 conference, and I wanted to share what it was like.


*The Organization of the Event*


* There was no signage or people around the building to help direct you to where in the convention center the conference actually was; no room numbers given to go to, just a side of the building (West). I've never been to the convention center before (it's HUGE), and I got lost. I also talked to a number of other people at the conference, and every person I talked to was lost at first.


* If you bought a certain tier of ticket, you are asked to register ahead of time for certain sessions, but during the conference it was not clear where registered vs unregistered people go. They needed signs or line separators. It was literally a huge group of people standing around, until somebody working there actually walked around and told us what to do.


* Trash on tables between sessions, so you couldn't tell if seats are “taken” by coffees or if it’s just trash left behind. Like it wasn't a ton of trash, but there was at least one or two coffee cups left on each table when we went into new sessions, and you can't tell if that's a person trying to save a seat or if it's just garbage, but it turned out to just be garbage the majority of the time.


* Somehow they didn't have enough printed stuff for certain sessions. You know how many people will be in the session, and even if you let in extra people, print out extra sheets to be prepared.


* The food was very tasty IMO, but I'm pretty sure that you have to get food through the convention center or through a food company they may contract out to.


* The food the first day of the conference had nothing for vegetarians other than a caesar salad. The second day they had two dishes for vegetarians other than salad.


* They did record the sessions, and they were also insistent on people speaking into the microphones so they would be heard on the recordings and so that people who are hard of hearing could hear everything.


* The staff members were very nice.

* Today they didn't serve lunch until 2 p.m., which to me seemed pretty late, but that's a smaller detail for sure in the grand scheme of things.

* The wifi actually worked well, which usually doesn't happen at a conference.

* Lunch was included when you bought your ticket, which is cool.



*The Content*


* The conference wasn't really a women in Tech conference as much as it was a women in technical management conference. The majority of the talks focused on things like: how to run a team, the future of agile, why we need diversity and how a lack of diversity affect us, how to build trusting teams, and how to lead. Even the few that happened we're just at an incredibly high level, like very simplified, and they were about pretty broad & popular topics like AI and ML, nothing really new or experimental or anything actually technical. The content of the presentations was great if you are in technical management or are a woman in a tech company in a non engineering position, but if you are an engineer, don't expect to learn any hard skills at this conference. For a women in **tech** conference, this conference was incredibly non-technical.


* Some of the speakers were VERY good. Please note that I'm not knocking the speakers themselves as a whole. My last bullet was specifically about the content over all of the conference, and the spread, or lack thereof, of different topics.


* Two of the keynote presentations weren't really relevant or presenting about anything that was useful. I remember sitting there thinking, why is this person giving **this** presentation right now, and why is it a **keynote**?

* Three other keynote speakers were very inspiring and had very relevant presentations.


* There were a number of presentations explaining why diversity is important and how diversity can bring good things for your company and product, but at a certain point it's like, if I'm at a women in Tech conference I'm not likely the person that needs to be convinced that we need more women in tech (and there's only so much I can do about this issue in my company), and I especially don't need five different presentations on that same topic at the same conference. I know that sounds really goofy to say because I do want more women in tech, but I'm not the one that needs convincing, so the same topic over and over was repetitive and not super helpful.


*To sum up:*


If you are a woman in an engineering position and have ever gone to the Grace Hopper conference, absolutely don't bother going to this unless someone (work or school) pays for it all.

If you are a woman in tech who is not in an engineering job, this conference has useful information, but a number of the topics are things that have been presented about a lot before, so if you've ever gone to another women in tech type conference, this one will be a bit repetitive.


If you can't go to the Grace Hopper conference for whatever reason, this is okay to go to if your job or school pays for it because it's better than nothing, but I wouldn't say this is worth flying to or paying for yourself. If it's not a short commute to the conference, don't bother.",5238,testimonial injustice,get back woman tech east coast 2019 conference want share like organization event signage people around build help direct convention center conference actually room number give go side building west never convention center huge get lose also talked number people conference every person talk lose first buy certain tier ticket ask register ahead time certain session conference clear register v unregistered people go need sign line separator literally huge group people stand around somebody work actually walk around tell us trash table session tell seat take coffee trash leave behind like ton trash least one two coffee cup leave table go new session tell person try save seat garbage turn garbage majority time somehow enough print stuff certain session know many people session even let extra people print extra sheet prepare food tasty imo pretty sure get food convention center food company may contract food first day conference nothing vegetarian caesar salad second day two dish vegetarian salad record session also insistent people speak microphone would hear recording people hard hearing could hear everything staff member nice today serve lunch 2 p seem pretty late small detail sure grand scheme thing wifi actually work well usually happen conference lunch include bought ticket cool content conference really woman tech conference much woman technical management conference majority talk focus thing like run team future agile need diversity lack diversity affect us build trust team lead even happen incredibly high level like simplify pretty broad popular topic like ai ml nothing really new experimental anything actually technical content presentation great technical management woman tech company non engineering position engineer expect learn hard skill conference woman tech conference conference incredibly non technical speaker good please note knock speaker whole last bullet specifically content conference spread lack thereof different topic two keynote presentation really relevant present anything useful remember sit think person give presentation right keynote three keynote speaker inspire relevant presentation number presentation explain diversity important diversity bring good thing company product certain point like woman tech conference likely person need convince need woman tech much issue company especially need five different presentation topic conference know sound really goofy say want woman tech one need convince topic repetitive super helpful sum woman engineering position ever go grace hopper conference absolutely bother go unless someone work school pay woman tech engineering job conference useful information number topic thing present lot ever go another woman tech type conference one bit repetitive go grace hopper conference whatever reason okay go job school pay good nothing say worth fly pay short commute conference bother,woman,job,tech,developer,software,0.78686804,devalue,0.04,offensive,0.04,incompetent,0.04,woman,0.642249288,award,0.126086725,excuse,0.079103498,0
girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:03,2023-09-28 23:34,syrenashen,Post,Ode to my women mentors and women managers,16v0vi3,,"I'm a woman who's been in this industry for 10 years, 15 years including internships. I never coded before college, but due to a large amount of encouragement from both women and men around me, I got a degree in CS against my parents' wishes and my own expectations of myself.

I've been talking to many women in this industry and reading about their experiences here which made me realize how lucky and unique my experiences were (although I don't think it's just luck\*), so I wanted to virtually thank the many women mentors in my life that have helped get me where I am today.

I was lucky to have gone to a school that didn't have a 50/50 ratio in CS but it wasn't far off either. It's an engineering school that consciously tries to maintain a balanced ratio. My CS class was around 60/40 which was really fucking great, so I never had the experience of being the only woman in the class. I didn't know how to code AT ALL, and tbh it was a huge struggle but no one said ""girls shouldn't be here"" or anything to me just because there were so many amazing female role models, professors, TAs, and grad students around.

My first serious internship was an internship at Google. I applied super late because I didn't believe I'd get accepted (I applied in May which, if you have normal summer internship experience, that's very late for an internship that starts in June). There weren't many projects left but someone at Google saw my resume and picked me up and asked for a super late internship slot for me, got it approved, and that was when I got my dream of interning at Google. I learned how to program there. I had never done production-level coding on a team before; most of my schoolwork was solo coding or theory-based so I had not worked with more than 1 person on a codebase. So that internship really taught me a lot.

My mentor was also great; I was out sick for a few weeks during the 12 week internship, and she got an approval to extend the internship a few weeks so I could submit my project and get a return offer. I didn't end up going back to Google, but she taught me a lot. At the time, I felt guilty & thought ""Gee why is this woman spending all of her time teaching me, a clueless noob, the complete basics of coding including how to use the command line? And debugging things for me when things go wrong? This can't be fun or benefitial to her."" I felt like I brought no value as an intern, but she told me that bringing value as an intern is considered going above and beyond.

After that I worked at a company that had almost no women. It was super toxic and people were constantly threatening & harassing each other. I got reported to HR a few times for stupid things like my short skirt bothered people. I left after 6 months.

Then after that I got a job where I had a series of managers. My first manager, a man, was nice to my face but shit talked about me behind my back. People were coming up to me telling me that my manager was disappointed in my progress, thought I was a mistake hire, etc, and I didn't understand why or how to improve because he never said ANY criticism to my face. He always said ""good job"" and didn't bother to give me any direction on what to work on. I cried a bunch after receiving that 2nd-hand feedback, until suddenly my manager quits and I got a new manager, a woman.

Some male co-workers told me my new manager sucked, and I cried again and contemplated switching teams. But she was really nice and supportive. She told me that she would help me get promoted, something my previous manager never ever mentioned. I felt like she cared about me as a person and my growth as an engineer. She maintained a team that was around 50% women. I have a few close friends from that team still. I ended up transferring teams anyway, though I left on a high note, and she gave me glowing reviews to my new team.

My next manager was also a woman, and we were in a satellite office. The team was >50% women. We even had cancel the ""Women in Tech"" ERG chapter in that satellite office because it was too many women. She said it felt like it would be more exclusionary than inclusionary due to the office being >50% women. I didn't get along with her too well due to differences in opinion, but she still treated me fairly. Again, I really appreciated being in such a balanced gender team. I did end up getting laid off during a companywide layoff during COVID, and she cried when I was laid off and was super supportive. She also quit afterwards in protest.

After that, I joined a new company and a team that was again 50% or even >50% women at times, under a woman manager. She was amazing. She was both my manager and my mentor. First of all, she hired me at a higher level than I was expecting. I literally thought there was no way I'd be hired in at that level. So much so that I only found out I was hired at that level *after I joined*. (It was an L for negotiation though.) After that, she got me by far the highest impact projects on the team and promoted me again in 1 year. I never thought I'd be in this position and gained so much confidence from the experience because my previous career trajectory was not going anywhere near that fast. I realized just how important your manager's support is.

Finally, now I started a startup with another woman, a three-time successful founder, and we just got funded by a top VC. I'm super excited and find her super inspirational. In fact, every day I feel lucky that she picked me of all people to work with. She has lots of different strengths that are complimentary to mine, and I learn a lot from just observing her interact with the product & the people around us every day. I feel super lucky.

Anyway, all this to say: TL;DR: Female mentors and managers have been the reason I'm where I am today. Balanced gender ratio teams are fucking awesome. Keep fighting for this world because as someone who has worked with a few male managers and heavily male-dominated teams, it makes a HUGE difference. I've had a few male mentors as well, but this is an ode to my most wonderful, superhuman, generous, kind, inspirational, selfless, extremely competent woman mentors 🙏✨

\*I don't think it's just luck but also selection bias. I think women managers are more likely to hire women, and also women like me are more likely to join teams with more women. I've had offers where I'd be the only woman and that always gave me the ick. I do understand that most other women in the industry don't have the luxury of choosing safer teams.",6542,testimonial injustice,woman industry 10 year 15 year include internship never cod college due large amount encouragement woman men around get degree c parent wish expectation talk many woman industry reading experience make realize lucky unique experience although think luck want virtually thank many woman mentor life help get today lucky go school 50 50 ratio c far either engineering school consciously try maintain balance ratio cs class around 60 40 really fuck great never experience woman class know code tbh huge struggle one say girl anything many amazing female role model professor tas grad student around first serious internship internship google apply super late believe get accept applied may normal summer internship experience late internship start june many project leave someone google saw resume pick asked super late internship slot get approve get dream intern google learn program never do production level cod team schoolwork solo cod theory base work 1 person codebase internship really taught lot mentor also great sick week 12 week internship get approval extend internship week could submit project get return offer end go back google taught lot time felt guilty thought gee woman spending time teach clueless noob complete basic cod include use command line debug thing thing go wrong fun benefitial felt like bring value intern tell bring value intern consider go beyond work company almost woman super toxic people constantly threaten harass get report hr time stupid thing like short skirt bother people leave 6 month get job series manager first manager man nice face shit talk behind back people come telling manager disappoint progress think mistake hire etc understand improve never say criticism face always say good job bother give direction work cry bunch receive 2nd hand feedback suddenly manager quits get new manager woman male co worker tell new manager suck cry contemplated switch team really nice supportive told would help get promote something previous manager never ever mention felt like care person growth engineer maintain team around 50 woman close friend team still end transfer teams anyway though left high note give glow reviews new team next manager also woman satellite office team 50 woman even cancel woman tech erg chapter satellite office many woman say felt like would exclusionary inclusionary due office 50 woman get along well due difference opinion still treat fairly really appreciate balanced gender team end get lay companywide layoff covid cry laid super supportive also quit afterwards protest join new company team 50 even 50 woman time woman manager amazing manager mentor first hire high level expect literally think way hire level much find hire level join l negotiation though get far high impact project team promote 1 year never think position gain much confidence experience previous career trajectory go anywhere near fast realize important manager support finally start startup another woman three time successful founder get funded top vc super excite find super inspirational fact every day feel lucky picked people work lots different strength complimentary mine learn lot observe interact product people around us every day feel super lucky anyway say tl dr female mentor manager reason today balance gender ratio team fuck awesome keep fighting world someone work male manager heavily male dominated team make huge difference male mentor well ode wonderful superhuman generous kind inspirational selfless extremely competent woman mentor think luck also selection bias think woman manager likely hire woman also woman like likely join team woman offer woman always give ick understand woman industry luxury choose safe team,woman,job,tech,developer,software,0.476082056,guilty,0.52,devalue,0.02,offensive,0.02,woman,0.706898269,attractiveness,0.106765759,excuse,0.055480306,0
