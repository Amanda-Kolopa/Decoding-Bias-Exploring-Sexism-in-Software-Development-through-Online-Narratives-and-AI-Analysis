But if that is true, one explanation is that women are making rational choices with the circumstances they have. If women want to spend more time with people, or work shorter hours to spend more time with family, then it seems to me to be a mistake to second-guess that choice.

I wouldn't entirely agree with this. They have no way of knowing all the features and functions of an application. Sure they do some checks but buggy and malicious apps still sneak through.

What Google and Apple do provide though is a way to interface with their OS and hardware. These are called software development kits (sdk) which make it easy for developers to write software that interfaces with the operating system. 

For example, if a developer wants to use the phones camera, the SDK provides a simple way to do this. The developer would write something like 'openCamera()' and the OS would take care of asking the user for permission to access the hardware, accessing the gallery and then showing the output of the view finder in a window. 

Basically this takes all the tedious tasks away from the developer and simplifies development in turn, resulting in less bugs.

The idea that it is ""ternary ready"" for when such processors come out is of dubious value as well because we don't yet know exactly how the hardware commands will operate on that architecture yet.

It's a little like saying that someone could write down a series of zeros and ones in 1880 and say ""Once they get a binary computer made, they can just type this in and it will run."". Nope. Sure we had mathematicians writing ""programs"" before computers existed, but this was more like psuedocode than real code. Example: They could easily assume that something like a for or while loop would exist, so they could write an algorithm that someone in the future could translate into whatever the machines actually used.

So writing a program in ternary now is sort of the functional equivalent of trying to write a program for a programming language which hasn't been invented yet.

I was afraid to get bored in FE dev + it’s an over saturated market where I live and I feel I don’t have the profile to become a competitive profile as a back dev. So I went back to e-commerce.

- The fact that a lot of companies and industries still have the reputation, (deserving or not) that tech roles are unsafe for women.

I’m reaching out to see if any of you are Customer Success Managers at software companies.

I’m a finalist for a CSM role, which would be my first role with this title. I have worked in the tech startup space for the last seven years wearing many different hats, such as virtual assistant and people operations manager. I’m burnt out being in the HR landscape and decided to make a transition. I want this role and know I’ll excel at the relationships building aspect and be proactive regarding addressing issues. However, I’m nervous about the sales aspect as I haven’t had significant sales experience. I did ask one of the interviewers what their preferred sales methodology was, one which I’d never heard of, so I bought a couple of books on it and am waiting for those to arrive.

Also, my imposture syndrome is trying to rear its ugly head and tell me I’m not good enough for this role. It’s also reminding me that sometimes when I’m presenting, I get nervous, and my stutter comes out (there will be presenting in this role). 
 

So to summarize, do you all have any tips for CSMs just starting out? And how do you manage imposter syndrome?",1179,gendered split perception,,,hello reach see customer success manager software company finalist csm role would first role title work tech startup space last seven year wear many different hat virtual assistant people operation manager burn hr landscape decide make transition want role know excel relationship build aspect proactive regard address issue however nervous sale aspect significant sale experience ask one interviewer prefer sale methodology one never hear buy couple book wait arrive also imposture syndrome try rear ugly head tell good enough role also remind sometimes present get nervous stutter come present role summarize tip csms start manage imposter syndrome,0.406818182,Objective

There are better and worse companies but I think some of it is human nature. It's good to be proud of your work and your team, if you have people under you, and it can make for a better working day. But bosses who pull your associates to give to another team or expect you to do more make it counterproductive.

Software is a commodity now, everyone has access to tools that allows them to create a program if they have the time and motivation. When a company wants to make a program, they have to program it as fast as they can for two reasons:

1. To reduce costs by limiting the amount of time programmers have to spend coding;
2. To get the program out before any competitor around the globe in this highly competitive market to get as much market share as they can to get the most profits;

These motivations are causing sloppy, bloated non-optimized code by nature. For them, it doesn't matter if it barely works or if it contains bugs, because the internet allows them to patch it later in an update. It's not as critical as when everything was offline back in the days, and we have way more computational power on our devices anyway so that the bad coding is still usable. Almost no costumer is going to notice what you did in the backend of your program anyway. Companies cannot afford to spend a couple of years creating a program except for a few of them, because by the time the project is complete, someone else will already have flooded the market with they own product.

2.	security is perceived as cost center. This means there is a pressure to minimize number of jobs within an organization. This makes it important to get the most positive value out of the fewest people. This pushes away juniors, and see number #1. 
3.	Training juniors takes time and is a gamble. I currently spend more than 10 hours a week training my juniors, which is a significant investment.

As part of back end I also deal with designing, setting up, maintaining, and interacting with cloud infrastructure. I really enjoy working in this space as my favorite part of software engineering is working with data and doing something with it. When I switched careers I opted to go back to school to get a computer science degree. 

Full stack-oriented bootcamps tend to teach a JavaScript-based stack. I hate JavaScript as a back end technology. It’s fine for simple things like basic websites, but the moment I need to do anything complicated I strongly prefer a language like C#.

If you have coded enough to know that you enjoy UI work + basic tasks in the back end to serve the UI, then pursuing full stack makes sense.

However, my very conservative, financial advisor father has cast some doubt on my decision in regard to the economy and potentially limited job prospects. He also is adamant that ""everyone will know how to code soon"". Additionally, it's hard not to factor in all the headlines about larger companies laying off tons of employees.

I'm hoping to get some perspective from folks in the field. Is now a good time to dive in?

Thanks so much in advance!

A simple analogy is a large poster board covered in rows of same-colored stars. If you replace one of the stars with a different color, our biology will instinctively draw our eyes toward the differing colored star. However, if you increase the number of those differing colored stars until the population is large enough that it roughly or at least somewhat closely mirrors the other color population, then there's indifference. No amount of beating the drum is going to stop biology from being acutely aware of minority populations. But just because this happens doesn't mean that it's automatically bad or discriminatory.

For a business letter it will probably depend on your target, but since most Americans do not pay much attention to strict language usage, in most cases you can likely safely use it.

Whereas if I say “he told her she was being biased” now you know it is two individuals. Of course if we co-opt male (or female) as gender neutral then we end up with “he told him he was being biased” which implies two male individuals, so we have once again lost clarity and generated confusion.

If they are micromanaged, they will backstab you, if you are attempting to break the harmful cycle. 

My theory: IT people in their first working years are overwhelmed with pure technical problems.

They also prefer to be micro managed, because it is reducing their own burden of making decissions.

Just try to reflect on this. You may know some people in different stages:

* It usually starts with a focus on solving small scale issues. This type of person is prone to do premature optimization.
* Some years later, they realize that maintainability is more important than hunting the last bit of performance.
* Some years later, they slowly start realizing that the social mine field surrounding them is the true problem to be solved.
* ... (i hope you realize the pattern)

On a computer, a virus usually meant you either lost data (shredded your system), your computer was locked/encrypted and prompted you to pay someone to unlock (ransomware) and in some cases it was simple trojans/keyloggers to get your sensitive data. Obviously, if someone was malicious they went for #1, and if they wanted money they would go for method #2. There are far easier ways to get your data than #3, such as phishing, and computers tend to have way too much data stored for people to go through all of it in the off-chance they get something juicy on you.

Now, with phones, shredding or locking your system is not just more difficult, but also way less effective. Data is backed up to the cloud, resetting your phone or buying a new one is often enough easier than paying ransom to someone on the internet. But mobile data is more valuable, it is incredibly easy to come by, you can tap microphones, cameras, get all the contact information and everything you want. All the personal information, compressed on a small device. So data stealing is rampant these days. And it doesn't even have to be a trojan that installs unwillingly.

Mentors are a great resource for advice, venting, and - if need be - assistance in pushing back.

2. Find an ally. If you have any male colleagues who are sympathetic, ask them to back you up when you speak up. Men are dumb - a lot of them won't acknowledge anything without a dick attached to it. A word from a colleague may completely snuff out their behavior.

3 Tap into ""bad bitch"" mode. Worst case scenario, you need to have some go-tos for when they do harrass you.

For the explainers, drop some knowledge. Show you know what you're talking about by explaining to them in depth why each move they make is wrong/right. Make it apparent you know as much as if not more than them. If you need to get rid of them quickly, say, ""Don't you have to work on xyz?""

I've been in school for sometime headed toward a bachelor's in communications but about a year and a half ago switched to a degree in computer science. As many of my friends are Software Engineers, (and because of my love of tech) they encouraged me to look into the field. After putting in months of research the torch was lit and I was extremely excited about the possibility of engineering. The problem was ... switching my major. I pretty much still needed ALL of my Math courses, now add the higher level math courses that I need in order to get one computer course. It's just going to take me another 2-3 years to graduate with a bachelor's degree, despite all of the units I've already taken.

Then I started looking at SE immersive bootcamps to at least give me some skills where I could reach an entry-level, or internship as a SE so that I could work while spending these additional years getting my CS degree.

After reading such negative reviews on these programs I started to feel totally stuck until I found WGU's 2 year bachelor program. If this is legit, it would take me so much less time to get my bachelor's this way, and from the reviews I've read, WGU degrees are widely accepted by potential employers.

Anyone have good/bad/ugly experiences to share?

Thank you,

While I think Damore acted like a jackass and then complained when he was fired for being a jackass, there exist points he made in the memo which I agree with. However, I will not pretend that those things I believe to be true are known to be true at a very fundamental level. Psychology and neuroscience are just not up to the task. I’m not bashing on psychology, psych is very hard, and fundamental theory in it looks pretty impossible.

As a woman in STEM myself, I've been having mixed feelings about efforts that are all about ""encouraging girls into STEM"". 

Although I don't oppose it and lean into supporting it (I personally believe diversity is not just beneficial but important, and as a student in a program where women only make up 7% I know how lonely it can feel), I'm still not quite passionate about it either. I'm also skeptical of its benefits as I keep hearing of women being properly ""encouraged"" only to leave later because the environment is still problematic - i.e. what's the point of doing this if they'll just leave later, anyway? (So: I have strong feelings about making the environment more welcoming to women and other minorities, but mixed feelings about the encouragement itself.)

However, I admit that most of my negative feelings stem from my own experiences (being spotlighted when I don't want to be for representation reasons, being encouraged to do stuff just because of my gender in a ""hey you should apply so they'll have more women"" way, etc) instead of anything rational. I also had the privilege of being raised in a household with gender equality, so it may be my personal bias, too.

As such, I'm wondering if anybody has recommendations on resources on why this ""encouragement"" is important? Blog posts, opinion pieces, Reddit comments - preferably by women in STEM, too. I've tried googling, but kept finding ""how"" instead of ""why"".

1. Remembering that people are inherently selfish and no one cares about you. This helps a lot in general with anxiety, but think about yourself every time you've seen someone speak. Were you thinking about the persons outfit? Or thinking about what you know about them outside the speech? Were you being malicious in your thoughts and making fun of the person? No. If you're interested, you're listening to what they're saying and if you're not, you're probably not paying attention. Whether that's thinking about your own to-do list or looking at your phone, if you don't want to hear the content you're not going to actively listen to it. So remember that with your audience. Those people either A) want to be there and want to hear what you have to say or B) don't want to be there and probably aren't listening. For the ones that want to be there, they likely regard you as someone more knowledgeable in the topic, since they're there to hear you speak. Group A is not going to judge you because they respect you, Group B doesn't care enough to judge you.

2. I took a public speaking class. I'd always been okay standing up in front of people, but this class taught me the finer points of public speaking.

Running as root offers you a solid way to really mess up your device, but it's not required to install a virus.

There are ways to bypass these trusted stores, but most users don't ever install things like that (or even know that they can). 

To get a virus on a typical user's phone would require getting it past google or apples security and onto their store, which is much harder for a malicious software engineer to do than on desktops where a user can download something from anywhere. As such, the effort to reward ratio is quite low.

Also, because it tends to happen while someone is in custody of whichever jurisdiction, it tends to be violent criminals with high rates of life-threatening STI's such as hepititis, syphilis, and HIV that are doing the raping. They will also tend to use violent means to control during the rape, such as knocking/choking them out first or beating them into submission first, sometimes within an inch of their life.

Also keep in mind rape of men in custody happens FAR more often than rape of women does. Many of these men are being held temporarily for a crime they did not commit or for something petty/nonviolent such as a weed charge or traffic tickets. It is not uncommon for rapists/murderers to be held in county. Often times they run out of room in higher-tier facilities, so they fill the spaces in county/lower tier facilities.

Females get the spotlight for complaining about rape because they tend to be the ones complaining about all the things to begin with.

It good to ask the questions your asking, because it brings us closer to the truth. But the fact of the matter is this is an endogenous problem. Biology influences social behavior in the short term.

YTA, you've made unnecessary and psychologically harmful comments to a subordinate.  Instead of taking responsibility for both your inappropriate response to her and your lackadaisical expectations of your team, you've doubled down and put all the onus on her. 

This could have been a teaching moment for your insular group of ""pasty, nerdy tech dudes"" to learn how to respect their colleague and grow as people. A teaching moment *you* should be leading. Instead your comments and lack of action has created a hostile work environment.

My nerves are terrible but what i've learned along the way is: 

\- Type up your notes in large font and print them ONE sided. also number the pages in large font as well. That way if you get confused you won't be looking at the backs of pages. handwriting (what does that word say?) in ink (shit my clammy palms smeared it) and double sided (wait where was i again?) is all dangerous territory. Yes you can use the speaker notes if you have a powerpoint/equivalent presentation software but then you're tethered to a monitor where you have to hope you can read those notes. Walking around and changing the person you look at can hide some fidgets and that's harder to do if you're behind the podium/screen. 

\- My notes are in bullet format, not more than 10 words per bullet and then I underline the key words in another color so that way when i look down i can scan for the points of color that put the keyword in context and triggers my memory

\- Practice, practice outloud, practice in front of someone else, and read it over and over again until you're comfortable with the materials. Doesn't need to be the same every time. 

\- Take some time before the presentation to just zone out. Usually if i'm presenting as part of a group when the others on my team are speaking i know what they're about to say. So i use that time to just breathe and be grounded

\- Remember that of everyone else in the room, not a single one could do what you're doing, if they could, you wouldn't need to present the information to them.

“This event is for women & nonbinary only. What is your gender?”

“Sorry, this hackathon is only for underrepresented genders in tech. Please check out ___ other hackathon for everyone else here ___ “

Registration form then cannot move forward, unless another gender is selected. Cis men received a kind redirect. You could even offer another channel for cis men to still be involved in the event.

It forces them to think twice about lying. It’s NOT illegal. And guess what? Cis men are welcome to lie. We’re not going to throw them out. We don’t check IDs. We know that non-binary can look very cis on the outside too so we really don’t bother investigating it. But cis men do lie we won’t be cultivating a vibe to make them feel safe doing so. 😂  and if you feel so desperate for a safe space to lie then by all means join the event, you never know when someone just needs a safe space from toxic masculinity, because in the end that’s what we’re about.

I’m glad to hear you have a therapist and they’re helping you navigate being a caregiver. However, they should also be helping you manage burnout - it’s common for a caregiver to experience, especially on top of your career. Please talk with them about it, and consider seeking alternate/additional therapy if they can’t help with this issue. 


For what this is worth, I’m also going through severe burnout due to work/life/chronic pain. I’d been treating it as “do I keep this job or find something else?” which causes a lot of agonizing over a very difficult choice. However, there is a third option - my doctor signed FMLA paperwork saying I need to be out of work for an extended amount of time. It protects my job and my benefits and gives me a chance to recover before I seriously consider a major career move. My employer has a leave donation program, so I hopefully won’t have to take as much unpaid leave as I might otherwise. It would be worth exploring whether your current company offers a similar program for paid time off. I think it would absolutely be worth talking to your doctors about FMLA protected time off as both a caregiver and someone experiencing burnout. 


Dipping into savings to take unpaid leave or a break feels risky, but consider this: you’ve worked hard to build savings for when you need it. This is a time when you need it. Use the resources you have to take care of yourself.

The other woman mostly works from home and the person I share an office with does the same - we're not technically supposed to do that all the time but nobody is doing anything about it due to short staffing and not wanting to lose more people.

It might be partly my anxiety talking but I at times feel very out of place and like people tip-toe around me. I smile, say good morning, ask how people are etc but a lot of them seem slightly nervous around me. Is it just the fact that I am young and female? I make an effort to have lunch in the lunch room and join in on conversations (if I feel its appropriate) and with the slightly younger group of people in the other departments this seems to work well, however the men in my department (usually 40+ with kids) give me the impression I make them nervous despite my efforts to not be intimidating and being agreeable while still voicing my opinion as to not step on any toes.

I do my job well, and my manager is happy with my work. I know people might have been questioning my ability to do this job due to my young age but I have proven that I am capable.

(People tend to guess mid-30s — I’m sure some of that is because people assume that when you’re 40, you’re an old crone 😂) When I was younger, I did not make too much of an effort to look older. Part of this was because my industry is pretty well known for ageism. The other part was because I knew that as a young woman, I would present as less threatening to colleagues. 

Of course, this comes with the side effect that people did take me less seriously, but that was okay (for me) until I had been senior for a couple of years. I noticed that younger men with less experience would be assumed to be more competent than I was. So, once I got a lead position, I did make the shift, but somewhat subtly. Of note, I work in an industry where the “uniform” is jeans and a hoodie. 

I actually took a somewhat opposite approach to another of the commenters. I do not wear much makeup, usually just mascara. I want my forehead wrinkles and crow’s feet to be visible.

I wear more feminine colors and styles regularly and prefer cardigans to hoodies, which I believe projects a confidence in my gender that I do not feel the need to “dress like a boy.” I mention my daughter so people know that I’m old enough to have a kid.

While the talks themselves have been good, the culture is just not a good fit for me at all. Maybe it’s partially an issue with my company’s culture but the sheer amount of drinking, gambling and sexualizing the waitresses has just made me super uncomfortable.

Whenever an app wants to do anything with hardware or a sensitive part of the system (like contacts), the user will be prompted to grant specific permissions.

It really got to my head, because I tried to network and kept getting told that I wanted something else by people I thought would understand my passion for it. It was really surreal. 

I'm so sorry that you went through that. It's surreal to have an interviewer interrogate you for doing too well, especially after all of that work preparing. You really did everything right and still got penalized for it. It also definitely screams sexism to me. I feel like bad interview experiences are a dime a dozen these days, and it's awful. I haven't even gotten any technical interviews yet, but just prepping for interviews seems like its own genre of hell. In most of my interviews it's nothing intentionally mean just.. *really* indifferent to me and my work, if that makes sense. 

One weird interview recently was a situation where the position wasn't available but they decided to tell me at the end of the scheduled interview after an hour of questions?  Instead of cancelling, just in case I was *secretly* a ML engineer with 10 years experience. I could see on their face the whole time that they weren't interested, and I kept getting more nervous thinking I wasn't answering correctly, when the truth was there wasn't a job at all. I wasted weeks going back and forth to set up the interview and prep just to have that happen. I know it could have been worse though.

Thank you for the advice, I will keep working on my little cybersecurity projects. I took a break from them because  I had my confidence shaken very early on in the job hunt and it was too painful to unearth.

I think the biggest source of anxiety is that I was hired for a senior role. Coming into the industry as a software engineer, I was told that it took around 5 or so years to climb up a senior role. I've had barely two YOE, so it definitely feels like this company took a bet on me. My manager even said they'd hired me because they saw potential, not experience.

Some other things that have been biting at me - my work so far has been very different than anything I've done before (web development instead of working above the OS) which means more stumbling in the day-to-day work, it's a smaller company than my last, so everything operates at different speeds (which I'm still adjusting to), and I'm working more cross-functionally than I've ever done before (a whole skillset on its own).

My managers (multiple) have said good things about my work, as well as other engineers I've worked with, so maybe I should be giving myself more credit. But being the young, anxious soul I am, that's easier said than done.

Right now I'm taking Google's UI/UX design and I really like it. I thought I would have to learn to draw and it just seems like I need to know visual design tips and principles and how a company does their design process. I've heard that drawing skills aren't needed in most places because most of the design is based on research (which is another aspect that I really love and would like to specialize in). Like if research says a call to action button is better in a certain spot then that's where it'll be placed in the design. 

I've also seen a few 'day in the life' videos of UX designers and it seems like a lot of talking and being in meetings for most of the day. I am introverted, might be autistic (haven't been tested for it yet), and I don't like small talk. However, I don't mind talking about work and evaluating peers'work to make something better. That's one thing I really like about this job, it's collaborative heavy with taking in different opinions and backgrounds and using all of that to come together and solve a problem/design challenge (at least that's what it seems like at Google).

  So I feel like I would be okay as long as the conversation stays about work. However I've also learned that with the collaboration aspect being able to get along with others is a desirable trait. That is something I do need to work on (but I think this goes for every adult human being). I can be cordial and respectful but not really personable, if that makes sense.

Love pantsuits btw and minimalistic outfits are also cool imo. And makeup is a constant companion, specially red lipstick and mascara.

I'm not sure what environment you work in really but I doubt people will actually judge you for dressing well. I do understand what you mean about getting respect but my perspective is slightly different here- I'm brown and I feel like if I dress down I might blend straight into the background or be unnoticed.

No, you didn't make a mistake. 6 months after a bootcamp is an OK time to move to another job if you really hate it; you'll probably just be getting on top of the code base of your current project by then. But I predict you won't.  


4 months -- right now the whole code base is utterly overwhelming. In a few weeks' time (around 6-7 months) it will all come together -- you'll see some bug that needs fixing, you'll realise that what's causing it is the subtle interplay between two different bits of the code base... and you'll be right.

Don't do this. Give yourself a break, it's okay. Pushing yourself too hard is unlikely to lead to better outcomes. Even today as a reasonably experienced software engineer (as much as one can be in their twenties) I do most of my hard thinking when I'm *not* working. The relaxed breaks give your brain time to mull things over and be creative. Watch a mindless episode of something or work on a different problem and you may well find you come back refreshed.

Break problems up and look at them in different ways. Sometimes a diagram scribbled on paper (or our favourite, drawn on the fridge) gets you a lot further than just thinking about code. Don't be afraid to look up answers sometimes, but make sure you fully understand how they work. If you look something up, give it an hour or a day then try to do it again from memory. If you do look things up, try to find only text/diagram/pseudocode explanations or implementations in another language so that you can learn from translating into Java yourself.

Every time you find the solution to one problem, you gain a tool for solving every other problem you see. Things get exponentially easier that way, as more and more problems start to look like one's you've already solved. You'll get there.

Try not to push yourself to the point where it's not fun for you. Enthusiastic playful exploration is the best learning tool there is.

> I've been doing nothing but Java for a week straight now

A week is no time at all, don't expect so much of yourself. I've been writing code for, dunno, like 15 years now? I still learn new things every day, and mock my six-month old code for how bad it is because of how much better I've gotten in that time. You never stop learning.

I was a mediocre student then. My best piece of advice is to figure out what motivates you. For me, that was being accountable to other people. After a year or year and half, I had met friends in my major and formed a study group and that was the only reason I graduated.

Most guys (not all!) I met in undergrad and in my career were not short on confidence, even when it was clearly misplaced. Being a poor student made me really insecure for a long time, which I think compounded the confidence gap that a lot of women have.  Anyway, between my poor grades and poor confidence, I think many early opportunities were lost to me.

As far as my experience with sexism in the work place goes, eh, it's very subtle in my field. It's more like, several guys on your team, including your lead, become buddies and go hiking/ to baseball games/ golfing and never really consider inviting the girl because they're all married and inviting a girl would be awkward/ a girl probably isn't interested in said activity/ you just don't click with them as easily. Sometimes it's harder to get a word in during meetings or to get people to listen to you, but I think that has more to do with people's (more likely too be a guy thing) egos than a judgment about you.

Sexism in undergrad was a bit worse. Guys were judgmental of the attractive girls (the girls who were actively trying to be attractive). In hindsight, I think this was because we were all nerds at nerd school, so there was some assumption that girls trying to look attractive were trying to get an undue advantage and/or manipulate others.

It’s a simple equation, if you make a company more money than they pay you, then you can continue to ask and receive promotions.

Traditional societal jobs, such as teachers, cleaners, garbage men, etc. Don’t ‘make’ profit, therefor they are generally standardized to a livable wage.

If you make your boss a mill a year, it really doesn’t matter what gender you are when asking for a 10k raise.

Now, the fact that some people (statistically women) choose these jobs is generally assumed because they see value in other aspects other than money, they want to help, teach, learn, nurture etc. Or, sometimes, it’s just a stable job that pays the bills with less job stress than what you find in corporate environments.

Should we pay these roles more? Maybe, he’ll, education is really important and I’m sure we all want better quality teachers - but that decision is entirely separate from the fact corporate jobs pay more money to make more money. And traditionally, once these jobs pay more they become competitive, which draws more men into them as they thrive on a competitive nature.

Certain key areas will be optimized the first time and written prettily because you expect it to be heavily used.  Your professors hammer in the idea of pretty code hard knowing that some students have hilariously terrible decade old habits by the time they get there, which are hard to fix.

Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.

I (29f) only just found this sub and it is what I didn't know I needed! 

I could really use some advice from you all: 

I've been a backend dev for almost three years now. Didn't start out in computer science though. Went to uni studying something completely unrelated. Like many of you I decided I wanted to be in tech and took a coding boot camp. 

The company I work at is nice enough and so is my team, but I can't help but feel like I'm just not good enough sometimes, despite knowing that that I produce pretty alright code.

I know you shouldn't compare yourself to others, but there is this guy on my team who is a straight up coding wunderkind. Seems to do everything right, works at the speed of light, always coming up with good design ideas, taking exams left right and centre. Like senior level stuff. He's 2 years younger than me as well, shouldn't matter either, but somehow makes me feel worse. I just don't know how he does it all! 

Now me and this guy have been asked to head in a new direction. We're java devs and we've been asked to head into the direction of Azure and .NET core. And I just know that he's going to pick it up in no time. I try my best and I'm sure that given enough time I'll be a decent. NET dev. I just wonder how I should deal knowing that he's going to be better and faster at this as well? 

Does anyone have experience dealing with this feeling of competition and the feeling of insecurity that ensues?  

Or the feeling that I lack a good foundation because I didn't go to uni for computer science? 

I'm not usually insecure about this, but it's really getting to me lately.

The first is when I've been assigned a very vague, future-focussed task. I start to feel lost and overwhelmed. ""What if I get this wrong and everyone is upset with me? How am I actually going to finish this? I can't even see the parts of the problem.""

I don't have a great method for those problems, but I have noticed that it's been less troubling to me the more times I've done it. I think what helped me the most is I know a few very nice and experienced people who I could ask for advice. If I'm feeling anxious enough about a problem I'll actually feel compelled to stand up and walk around, which is usually when I go see them.

My peers are another great help for this. Pair work especially seems to help avoid getting stuck in a loop (even if many of my engineer type coworkers aren't so keen on extended social interaction!)

The other situations where I tend to feel bad (and good!) is when I'm working on a really tough bug. To me it's an emotional rollercoaster where I feel amazing after I think I've made a breakthrough in understanding the root cause, and then I feel absolutely terrible when my theory didn't work out and I feel like I'm stuck.

The two things I mentioned above can help with this problem too. But additionally I've found that it helps to remember when working on tough bugs that computers are (mostly) deterministic machines. If a bug can be reproduced, there has to be a root cause in there somewhere that I can find through careful searching. It's a ""murder mystery"" and I have to be the detective to find out which function dunnit 😂

A possible way is listing the things you do and consider the business impact to the client company. Not the work size or difficulty, but the value it brings when done.  When that's done, consider your capacity and create a proposed task list covering the most impactful things, preferably starting with the best impact/effort ratio. If there are less impactful things that critical to keep for whatever reasons, add those to the mix, but don't exceed your capacity (remove something else when you somethingto the list). You will end up with a list you propose to do and a list you will not have capacity to do (on hold).

Calibrate those lists with your stakeholders. First talk with your manager at the client company. Do they agree with the impacts? Do they agree with the capacity allocation across topics? Is there something in the on hold list that should be switched with an item in the todo list? Is it possible to delegate or share anything from the on hold list?

Once you have an agreement with your client manager, show the same list to the team lead and scrum master. Discuss expectations. If they disagree with the lists, get them together with your client manager and settle the open points.

Repeat the process later or agree on capacity % allocation across topics. 

Don't let them squeeze in just one more item without removing or scoping down another one. Be respectful, constructive and open to change the list through the whole exercise. 

If you have a good relationship with your reporting manager, you could also ask for their advice on the situation. 

I suspect that those tickets that has been open for 2 years are low impact, because no one cared to escalate them.

There's barely a difference between them. Even if you bar all businesses, business owners, etc. from donating money and lobbying, they will still have a hold over the politicians. Let me tell you why.

1.) Businesses/Individuals can fund ads *almost completely unrelated to a politician* that just so happen to agree with the politician. Therefore, a politician is incentivized to support the interests of these businesses in order to get these *totally unrelated* (\*coughcough\*) ads to air.

2.) News media form your impression of various candidates. These candidates are incentivized to do as these news companies say in order to get more/better coverage. NBC and MSNBC are owned by Comcast. Being mean to Comcast means these channels may well put pressure on you with their coverage. Up until 2009, Time Warner Cable and CNN were owned by the same people meaning threatenng TWC was the same as threatening CNN, now TWC has merged to become Charter Communications which is 31% owned by Advance Newhouse (who owns newspaper companies/websites). Threaten Charter, you threaten Advance Newhouse. Politicians will not threaten the ISPs because threatening ISPs means threatening news companies which means threatening their own election campaigns.

3.) Threatening business means that businesses will declare a ""loss of confidence"" in a given economic area and either flee or take some form of ""drastic"" action (like layoffs) whether necessary or not. As a result, a politician that doesn't bend the knee threatens local economies. No politician wants to be the guy that destroyed the economy, it's bad for election campaigns, so any politician that doesn't want people to hate them will do what they can to benefit the business' owners.

Anecdote, I had a boss that came in and micromanaged me after I had been in a role for 2 years.

From that moment on, I followed up all meetings with takeaways and asked him to confirm my understanding, like “If I have a question, I will ask Google and not my manager.” 

It didn’t improve things, but it made me feel better to put it in writing. I left a few months later and he was baffled. He apologized and still peeps my LinkedIn profile to this day.

1. Phone operating systems were designed to run only signed applications, which makes it harder for malware to spread. If Apple or Google detects a virus in the wild, they can immediately remove the application from their store and usually can disable it remotely. 
2. Phone applications are run in a ""sandbox"" and typically can't access anything outside their box without getting user permission. MacOS has a sandbox now too, but many applications installed from outside the App Store don't use it. 
3. Phone applications are tested by Apple/Google before being placed into their app stores. 
4. Users cannot typically install kernel extensions or drivers on mobile phones. The hardware is less open than desktop systems that support 3rd party hardware and drivers. 
5. For a long time Microsoft valued backward compatibility more than security. Since updating applications is easier than it was 20 years ago, Apple and Google have taken the opposite approach - security is more important than backward compatibility. 
6. Older computer operating systems were completely insecure and any application could take over the entire system. MacOS X and Windows NT and later had some security features, but it wasn't until recently that serious security was a priority. Things that have helped include encrypted storage, access control lists, protected system files, signed system software and applications, and automatic updates. 
7. As for crashing, splitting the operating system into a kernel that rarely crashes and applications which sometimes crash has helped quite a bit. Also disallowing 3rd party kernel extensions and drivers has made kernels more testable and reliable.

They basically said a lot of these people obsess over really weird things like grinding Leetcode or internship hunting all day long. These people tend to not be socialized very well.

I know somebody who is probably a nutcase at this point. I'm not saying you're like this guy, but please consider it a cautionary tale.

So this guy walked around telling people they're wrong and he's right, often in a rude manner, with a lot of unnecessary name dropping, and a lot of needlessly putting other people down. When people talked back in a similar tone he felt insulted and escalated into more and more direct attacks. So very soon everybody was doing their best to avoid talking to him or giving him a chance to express his views (his views were mostly stupid, but I think that might be a consequence of his behavior rather than the source of the problem: since he never considered that he might be wrong, he kept entrenching himself further and further into extreme views). So anyway, eventually somebody higher up in the hierarchy was brought in to tell him to calm down, he claimed he was being suppressed by jealous people.

Obviously this guy is now out of a job and seems to be generally struggling in life. Yet he keeps on blaming it on other people. I went out of my way to try and help him but he pushed me away on the ground that I, too, am a jealous insecure person. Since he's been known to be threatening/violent, I'm now leaving him to continue his solitary descent into madness.

Again, I'm not saying you're that guy, or that you're even close to being that guy. It's possible that you're in a really bad environment, and that you are really surrounded by jealous insecure people. But in most places you are allowed to present your views provided you do so in a respectful way, without assuming immediately that people who disagree with you are jealous or insecure -- so if ""everybody"" is telling you to calm down, maybe consider toning it down a notch?",1936,gendered split perception,,,happens twice everywhere go probably worth consider possibility something wrong know somebody probably nutcase point say like guy please consider cautionary tale guy walk around tell people wrong right often rude manner lot unnecessary name drop lot needlessly put people people talk back similar tone felt insult escalate direct attack soon everybody best avoid talk give chance express view view mostly stupid think might consequence behavior rather source problem since never consider might wrong kept entrench extreme view anyway eventually somebody high hierarchy bring tell calm claim suppressed jealous people obviously guy job seem generally struggle life yet keep blame people go way try help push away ground jealous insecure person since know threaten violent leave continue solitary descent madness say guy even close guy possible really bad environment really surround jealous insecure people place allow present view provide respectful way without assume immediately people disagree jealous insecure everybody tell calm maybe consider tone notch,0.648835034,Subjective

- she slandered my reputation at the department, oversharing personal information and false information (other PhDs have told me what she said)
- she simply doesn't reply to me 
- she has refused to see me in person for almost 2 years, arguing that as I finished my field research, she is not required to do that anymore
- she takes credit for my achievements and blames all mistakes solely on me
- she has stalled my thesis review for 1 semester and now delayed my thesis defense for another semester. This is when I contacted the dean of our department for the second time to ask for help.

The dean and chair seem on my side and set up a mediation for next week. But I am still so scared how things are going to go. Because I know how she is. During the mediation she will either blame it all on me or just smile and say how sorry she is, that this is all a big misunderstanding, that the lies were miscommunications etc. Then everyone will tell me, see, things will be fine now!

The second job I thought he was just a good work friend, until he decided he wanted more (and became pushy on a work trip) and then started being very vindictive when he found out I was in a relationship. I had another job lined up, but my company wanted to keep me so I was able to transfer teams and work fully remotely, and ended up staying for a few more years.

I’m a first generation, first to go to college so I took the major leap to CS to get out of generational poverty. Despite all the imposter syndrome, stigma, and stereotypes I persevered through research, fellowships and internships. 

I’m 23 now and I took an extra year to graduate. Tomorrow I start my first day in my dream job as a product manager for artificial intelligence products at a major company. Last week, I signed a one-bedroom lease without a co-signer in San Francisco. The rent right now is “cheaper” due to COVID-19 and I got a good deal on the penthouse floor with a view of the Bay Bridge and the city. I know everyone says to live frugally after you graduate but I wanted to treat myself because all the hard work I’ve done (also I’m going to WFH so I want to enjoy my home). I’m actually more excited that I have a working kitchen because growing up all we had was a stove. I’m excited to bake things now lol! Also I bought a nice standing desk for myself as a graduation gift.

I would say what also helped me is seeking mental health resources and finding a social community. I’m still seeing a therapist and taking meds. I’ve met a lot of my best girl friends through internships and fellowships and hackathons who are all over the United States. I had to be humble myself and realize in this community that overworking and crying every time I failed at anything was not okay, so I prioritized my well being.

School is temporary and a series of hoops to jump through. Your career will be different; you will choose where to interview and work. 

If you need to go part time at school to have work life balance do it, but then increase the number of hours you spend practicing. 5 is not enough. Build portfolio projects that interest you, don't just crank out interview problems. Or get an internship at a good company with other women on the team -- that is a good sign of a positive work environment. Don't chase money, find a place that values diversity and respect where you can be mentored and build your skills.

Just take it one day at a time and work on what you can accomplish. You solve programming problems by breaking them into smaller problems -- that's how you need to deal with the challenges you're facing now. Compartmentalize and do one thing, then do another. Don't overwhelm yourself with the big picture. Do the best you can in the moment and let everything else roll off.

I was just speaking to an amazing engineer on my team today who has been a programmer for almost 40 years and he admitted to me that he thinks he is a bad programmer and struggles more than other people. He also said he has trouble in code reviews because he gets nervous. It is such a complicated field, and everyone feels overwhelmed by it (or should). You don't have to be good at everything, especially not right away -- just keep learning.

From personal experience, women who are doing fine in CS classes are more likely to think they are doing terribly and give up than their male counterparts. Don't fall victim to this mindset. And especially don't listen to the nasty comments made by men who are insecure and jealous.

Thanks guys!",eueh00z,,"So you're coming off as super condescending in your replies on this thread.

Yes. I wear PPE. However, just because a chemical may not require a certain level for safe handling with skin/human biology does not mean it is clothing safe at that level particularly over the long term. Nor does the fact you're doing some sort of science that you can do in a suit mean that all scientists are or that they're not being sufficiently safe if their work is harder on fabric.

When you work with a lot of strong acids or bases (or sensitizing materials like say photo developing fluid or even putrid things like cadavers), these chemicals can still get into fabric despite lab coats through evaporation/aerosolization in a way that causes small holes in fabric upon washing in the former category or a lingering scent. The necessity of using bleach in sterilization/cleaning of lab surfaces and floors or cell culture can easily wreck pants that aren't intended to be covered by lab coats. It's a lot easier to take splashing bleach on a 20 dollar pair of old navy jeans than a 50 dollar pair of tailored slacks. Further, even if chemically you can keep your closet safe, or you may be working with a hazardous material that necessitates more frequent laundering (for instance when I worked with feline herpesvirus and had cats, I did laundry every day i handled live virus so as to not even risk my cats) which also wears down clothes and makes dry-clean only options impossible. 

Suits may be something people who don't spend 60 hours a week in lab have enforced upon your workplace. A lot if times in industry, you're in a repetitive, controlled environment doing a very small range of tasks. So maybe if all you do is repetitive assays with salt-based reagents or something you'd be fine. But that doesn't mean it's the only way, or even the most reasonable for all of science.

Last year, I reported being inappropriately touched by a postdoc. I was forced to talk to my institutions Title IX office after coming forward, trying to get out of the lab I was in. It was reported to the PI on three occasions. The lab tech was also inappropriately touched. Several people saw this. Yale did not attempt to substantiate those claims. He also made inappropriate comments to a female undergrad that had been there previously. This was a pattern. First, when I told the PI about that, she laughed and said she, ""didn't get involved in personal matters"". The second time, we were standing in the lab, and I even asked the technician as well in front of her if she liked it when he came up and grabbed her from behind while she said 'no' and 'stop' repeatedly and tried to squirm away. She said she didn't like it. PI did nothing. Third try, I reframed it as a hinderance to my data. PI said she had NEVER HEARD OF THESE ALLEGATIONS BEFORE (lie) and only when her data could be affected did she do anything. When I reported this, I was made to stay out of the lab for two months-not the handsy post doc. Institution admitted that they knew I was touched, and said ""steps were taken to prevent a recurrence"". Nothing changed. We still had overlapping schedules. He's still there. When I opened the title IX report today, I was shocked to see that Yale said the claim was unsubstantiated. There were emails sent to other PIs questioning the conduct and relaying PIs response, consistently. Others who knew who the office said they wouldn't contact. This directly conflicts with what the investigators told me. I was told by two different investigators that they COULD substantiate my claims. That they had done something to prevent future incidents. Tonight, I opened their title IX report. I found mine easily.

They lied in their report. They didn't take it seriously. They have a national reputation for not taking harassment seriously, and it's spot-on.

There are times in life that you should try to calm down and learn to relax / spend time with family etc. but this isn't one of them because you are actually in a somewhat precarious situation and it makes sense to worry about it. 

A lot of us know about ""the gift of fear"" (learning to listen to fear since it is trying to protect you) but I notice a lot of women don't acknowledge ""the gift of worry"" — as soon as this situation came up, your brain immediately recognized the threat and switched into game mode. It's worth acknowledging that your brain is giving you what you need now: a sense of urgency and focus on your situation. You mentioned keeping your head up, but really you should put your head down and focus on getting through the situation. You don't need to gruel away for years on end — you just need to prioritize leet code / job searching etc. for a month or two (might be longer in the current market). It's ok to deprioritize other things in your life for a short period of time since losing your job sounds like it would be catastrophic for you. 

I could go on but in general: your worries are totally reasonable in this situation so focus on acknowledging how appropriate your response to this situation was and take care of yourself getting through this. Make sure you have others around you who understand this kind of stress and how tumultuous the industry can be.

Honestly, its hard to pinpoint. I don't discuss many topics other than work with them because no one ever asks me or includes me in conversations. They tend to talk to each other during meetings. There is some generic small talk occasionally but I think it boils down to my coworkers are immature. And I actually think one of them might have a crush on me. There's just a general air of awkwardness surrounding my presence lol. I told a therapist a few years ago that I think I might be intimidating and she said she could see that, if that helps.

When I am speaking, I feel like I have to qualify everything with 'I'm not sure but...' or 'yeah I was thinking it could be good that...' or 'you might want to..' etc. to come off as non-threatening. Someone who has since left the team became kind of hostile towards me because I didn't do this and spoke more directly. He would intentionally speak over me and roll his eyes at me in meetings, one time he was watching a YouTube video while I was trying to talk to him in a 1-1 meeting. He would be super critical of my work. 

I should also mention I have social anxiety and have struggled with speaking up for most of my life, so I have an amplified reactivity to feeling like I've said the wrong thing to someone. It's just exhausting to constantly feel like I have to consider how I'm coming off to them and how that ultimately might affect me and my relationships. Like, I'm punished for speaking up, but they also are telling me to speak up more.

You are going to encounter this, and worse, a LOT. Is it right? No. Is it gross? Yes. However you may want to take this as an “opportunity” to learn how to handle it and tolerate this. 

There is a reason over 50% of the women that go into my field leave within a couple years. Its a 1 woman to every 10 men ratio - of course if you go into web design or something you’ll have more women around but I digress…

Most of my job interviews in some way included a thinly- veiled attempt to ask me if I would report anyone on the team to HR. I am not exaggerating. You are seen as a RISK plain and simple. If a manager has an all male team, and they’re talking crassly to each other as part of a normal day - interviewing you is anxiety producing for that manager. No one wants to deal with an HR incident. 

So this professors comments? Yeah that is suuuuuuper mild amount of honesty about how most men are going to see you in this field.

Before I knew better, I almost blacklisted myself from jobs because I complained about some disgusting comments from a manager that were WAY out of line and frankly made me feel unsafe. The company response was to advise myself and that manager to never be alone together. That was it. He has three women complain about his sexism in one year and exactly NOTHING happened to him. In the mean time I was basically radioactive after that. 

College is not going to prepare you for the corporate world - I highly recommend you read a book called “Corporate Confidential” and at least understand how HR and managers will see you and your complaints.

What other courses are you having issues with? If you’re struggling with them and therefore they’re unenjoyable, see what resources your school has (such as writing centers if you struggle with the essays) or talk to the professors for help (when I worked at a university under a professor I often handled helping students and did what I could to help them pass and learn the information when they came in asking for help).  If it’s math or science courses, those are unfortunately/fortunately just part of getting a Computer “Science” degree and in my field understanding the basics of physics has been instrumental, and math is super important. So those classes were foundational to my success. Maybe if its a course you’re struggling with, try to reframe it to fit your future. You may not like taking a language, but languages are patterns and there are a lot of companies doing work in languages/translations and AI/ML.

Before that job, I had no idea how regulation worked. I always assumed when we wanted more government oversight, that a law was passed and then that fixed the issue. 

But it’s actually more intricate than that.

The general workflow for regulations goes like this:

Public demands that government regulate a particular activity that industry does which people don’t like (say, polluting the groundwater with fracking). 

The Legislative branch of government (Congress) writes and passes a law on a particular topic. 

That piece of legislation is usually fairly vague and authorizes the executive branch of the government (in my case, Department of Environmental Protection) to craft a Rule around that statute. The Rule is the single unit of regulation, which is more specific than the law and is easier to change. 

To change the law, the legislature has to pass a new bill which has to be signed by the head of the executive (Governor or President). Regulations, on the other hand, don’t need to go through all of that. But they do need to be properly and formally promulgated. 

Promulgation basically means writing a Rule in an appropriate manner. This means meeting with subject matter experts, holding town halls with the public, and consulting with the industry that the rule with impact. 

This last part can come across as unsightly or corrupt, but meeting with industry leaders is a good way to make sure that they understand what they need to do to comply with the new regulation but also make sure that the Rule is implemented properly and fairly. 

Industry usually just complains that the Rule is too aggressive or burdensome, but we also have to keep in mind that they are subject matter experts too in their own way. So if we want to prevent fracking from contaminating drinking water, a lot of times people working in the industry understand what are the most dangerous parts because they work with it every day.

My male, less senior than me colleague at the time and I went to a client meeting for a new client. My boss explained that he was coming along with me and I was training him. Communication was from me, with my colleague CC'd in so that he'd learn the operating rhythm.

Despite this, I had to spend the first 30 mins of the meeting explaining my qualifications and experience because ""why are you the senior one and not Colleague, here?"" Did he have to go through his qualifications and experience? Nope, not even 1 question. 

They insisted he took over and that I was removed because they said he'd be a better fit for them culturally (😂). He said he's fine, he's got this and my manager said - yep, let him handle it. So I was of course relieved because less work for me, I had all of my other clients to focus on and I was happy to get my time back and the colleague assured me he knew what to do and I wouldn't need to worry. So that was that. Not.

Guess what happened? I ended up rescuing those clients. They begged for me to come and fix it all in the last minute. I had to keep fixing stuff for them, long after that colleague ditched them in the middle of scary situations that I'd come in and fix. They eventually apologised and once portfolios were being switched up, they begged to come to me and I figured, what the hell, I do a lot of work for them anyway, so they became a client of mine.

But this happened and they caused themselves a lot of unnecessary headache because of my gender.

I suspect he's going for a promotion to senior, and might get it.

I should say that I am biased towards this person, as he comes from a very privileged background, and comes across to me as entitled, while I come originally from a poor country and background.

He is able to present himself in meetings, and when our manager is present, in a way that covers up the fact that he struggles with simple tasks. For example, the other day he was trying to figure out an error and asked (in a private message to me) how to proceed with the work, at which I had to suggest him to look for error messages in the logs (which is basic). Then he was asking me if it was the same error I had before (when I had done a fix on the same service), and if the same solution I did would work, when it was clear that it was a completely different error message and problem.

I would expect this from a junior, and would gladly help, but it feels that when he asks me for help he is offloading work on me, as well as asking me for ideas in order to take credit for them. This makes me uncomfortable, and I feel a bit reluctant to go over and above my duty to help him.

Right now, what happened is that he publicly did an announcement for a feature I had worked on, and wrote ""thank you for helping with this @ <my name>"". This was not ok for me, and I expressed my upset in quite strong terms (demanding that he delete the post, which he did), and this backfired on me, as my manager called me out on our 1-1 for not putting the team above myself.

And I agree 100%, I was surprised the number wasn't 4/5 instead of 1/5. I was surprised that 4/5 of the respondents didn't self report to be both a victim and a perpetrator of ""sexual assault"" when defined in this way.

(Interesting fact: the state of California tried to make having sex with someone that is drunk/high/on drugs actual, prosecutable ""sexual assault,"" with jail time, sex offender status, and everything, but they gave up when they realized that made a massive percent of the population would be prosecuted. No way could they keep you with a case load like that. They would issue more sex offense convictions than parking tickets.)

I didn't assume 2/3 of the stats are bullshit.

Like I said, I am talking about a very SPECIFIC kind of sexual assault.

I didn't say anything about fighting back. YOU did.

I guess it is necessary for me to define what I mean by forceable rape once more, because you have either forgotten or missed it the first time (or maybe I said something misleading/inaccurate).


Forceable rape:

Using threats or physical force to coerce someone into vaginal/anal sex.


One thing I have found is that the vast majority of pretty much all crimes tend to be men. They usually REALLY ARE the victims in most cases. Men are BY FAR the most common murder victims, for instance. This makes sense when you think about everything. Men seem to be way more likely to put themselves in the situation to get murdered. Men tend to be risk takers and women tend to be risk aversive.

I already told you the statistics on males being forced to penetrate being 4.8% in the GENERAL POPULATION (again, not counting those that are penetrated) and in prison ""being raped in their current facility"" (not ever, just in their current facility) is 7% of the prison population (in one sample).

- get involved in industry tech diversity groups, made up of people who work in different companies, as this will give you a more permanent support and friends in the industry. It won’t matter if you or they are laid off from one company, this community is independent of that.

- reflect on what you most want in a company, and when job hunting be selective to those that most meet that criteria. Working on a product you believe in, a values led company, good humanistic benefits, etc. This will improve the odds you like where you work and are well supported

- don’t buy into all the bro coder advice about grinding leetcode, unless you want to work at a bro coder company. FAANG companies might require Data structures and algorithms for recruitment, but many other companies don’t. Learn the skills that feel meaningful to you, and that matches with the kind of company you want  to work at.

- give you self a bit of self care. Sounds like you’ve been hard on yourself. Write a list of all the things you did and learned so far, to remind yourself that you actually do know a lot. Do whatever you need to do to improve your confidence - knowing confidence is independently of competence (even if you were the best coder could still feel insecure, so you need to ground your confidence in something else, know you are worthy, you deserve a good job).

- understand that in this industry people move around a lot. Even if they aren’t laid off, people job hop. Being laid off in this industry isn’t a terrible thing because it’s not hard to find another job.

One reason that a particular computer would get slower over time is that it's moderately hard for software to clean up after itself reliably and completely, so a machine that's been running for a long time might build up a lot of crap from things that were either upgraded or removed. Software also doesn't behave perfectly (to say the least!) and can be running even when it's not needed at the moment, so if in the past you installed a lot of things they might be consuming space/resources. In both these case, the oldie-but-goody method of 'reformat the drive and start from totally scratch' can work wonders. 

Another reason is malware and adware. Lots of machines that don't routinely update their software (and even some that do) get malware or intentionally have adware installed. These things try as much as possible not to grind the machine to a halt because it would alert the user who might try to clean them up. So (the good ones) try to be unobtrusive while also serving up ads or spam or whatever else they like to do. But as they are remotely controlled, their behavior can change suddenly and without any trigger. This one also gets cured by the 'reformat it' strategy, plus being extra careful about what you download and staying up to date with updates to the OS and browsers (and avoiding shady parts of the internet and using a good adblocker and . . . I can't make this a full post about not getting pwned!)

Another reason is that storage devices work fastest when they are less than 60-75% full. As it gets full, the hardware and software both have to work harder to write data to less and less open spots. Past 90 or 95%, things can really start to get very slow. So a computer might be getting slower over time if its storage is getting progressively more full.

Finally, as whiggly pointed out, it might just be that the applications you are running are getting more features (or maybe useless features) because they can. Or they might be getting fancier UI that takes more resources to run. There is a saying that software expands to consume all available resources.

I am always cautious to not be alone with people I don't really know and try to go always with a small group of friends, other women, or queer folks. 

I did have bad experiences with people trying to make unwanted sexual advances (nice euphemism!) or trolls trying to dox me. But I always had this wall of friends/allies around me that cut them early. If you don't feed the trolls, they usually forget about you. It is not fun to troll someone who muted you and is not even reading you.

For my online presence, I just keep a firm blocking/report/muting policy whenever someone starts annoying me. 

Specifically for my personal tech blog, I have a spam filter that also filters most trolls. If/when your blog becomes so big the task of reviewing comments becomes annoying, you can always turn down anonymous comments. I use Wordpress for my personal blog, but I also write in many other platforms that have similar features. Worst case: turn comments off. But don't worry, your blog will still have a loooong way before you have so many comments this is an issue.

At the beginning I used pseudonyms, but that was useless because I couldn't build a strong personal brand. I wanted to have a background I could show and people could find me. As in, when sending a proposal to a call for papers, have some background of who I am and why they should choose me.

The key is building your crowd of allies around you that defend you if needed. And if you don't have strong allies: block, report, mute, turn comments off until you have allies. Don't let that stop you! Your voice is important.

Anyway, it is always a good practice to hide your intimate/personal details and never post dangerous things. Like, don't post your address. Be purposely vague on where you live (or write on purpose misleading hints). Don't post your phone number. Don't share anything that could be used to steal your identity.

I'm curious to hear from those of you who graduated from coding bootcamps. I just finished a prep course for Codesmith and tbh I am trying to find out all the good, and the ugly about going into software engineering since I am looking to nurture a long-term career. I follow a lot of women tech influencers and I want to be as realistic as possible and know what I'm up against. I have transitioned 2 times in my career so far, but this would be the biggest learning curve by far. I feel that, in the recent months I've met more people who ""know someone who went to a coding bootcamp"" but they haven't gotten a job or they are working their old job still, that I fear the market is super saturated with people who are just starting out and honestly I'm scared and having tons of self-doubt. 

I would be starting from 0 in tech. But I am focused on the long-term. I'm at a point where I can't honestly say I'm passionate about anything in particular- I already fulfilled my dream job and I'm at that point of what's next? I was previously teaching abroad, and left earlier than I wanted to (life in Tokyo was fun!) because I realized I would eventually face having to choose a new career. the coding bootcamps in Tokyo were hard to work around with my teaching job, so I came back to the US. My boyfriend is a SWE and encouraged me to go into tech, he says do the bootcamp, get my foot in the door, and go from there. My people skills are my strong, so he's mentioned transitioning to a more people-oriented role within tech if I decide I would like that more down the line. So- as you can see a lot of overthinking and I have to accept I can't know the future! 

So I think I really need to talk to more people who followed this path before me. For those who would like to chime in, my questions are:

1. when did you attend your coding bootcamp?
2. What was your career prior?
3. what is your current job title?
4. is the career what you thought it would be? if not, why?

In fact a Jr SWE position is going to be more beneficial to your career than quitting a 4 month analyst role will be harmful.

Be polite, honest, but firm when you inform them: “I was recently offered a full time role in my chosen career track that starts in X weeks which I have accepted. Unfortunately this means I will not be able to complete the role you offered. I appreciate the opportunity you provided and wish timing could have been better. How would you like me to close out my remaining time here?”

Key points here:
1. After a specific date you’re gone and no longer working
2. The decision has been made
3. You’re sorry for the inconvenience but you’re *not* sorry for the decision
4. They have the opportunity to decide how you spend the remaining time: is there work you can get done or should they rip the bandaid? Up to them.

This happens more often than you think, as a manager I’ve had it happen a few times: sometimes before the start date sometimes after they had put in 2 weeks. I’m never happy about it, sure, but it’s not a “ruin their reputation make sure they never work in this industry again” thing. As annoying as these situations are, I’d much rather you leave and take the other offer than stay and be bitter about “what could have been”.

And when you do leave: don’t list the contract gig on your resume, don’t include it in future job applications. As far as you’re concerned it never happened.

That said: you do mention the analyst role is a contract, double check anything you signed for any penalties for early termination. It’s unlikey there’s anything beyond a notice period, but it’s good to be familiar in case they try to be… shady.

**edit:** last note: they may press and ask the name of the company you’re leaving them for. You don’t have to tell them and you probably shouldn’t unless you truly trust them.

Spent my entire time in one of the companies that you’ve listed (not going to specify which one here, though happy to chat in DMs).

I’ve personally not experience direct, malicious sexism in my career so far. The closest to sexism that I’ve experienced (and keep in my mind that I’ve been in industry for a while) was one time where someone didn’t know who I was and asked me if I was a PM. I’ve also dealt with (male) individuals that talked over me — however, they did these things as much to male coworkers (including those in leadership above them, oddly enough) where it was clear it was less of a gender thing and more of a “this person needs to learn a communication skill”.  Overall, I’ve found the company that I’ve been at to be very, very good at supporting its female employees.  

By happenstance, I’ve ended up mostly on teams where I was the sole female, with the exception of my most recent team switch. While that is not uncommon at most companies, the fact that the sexism I’ve dealt with has been pretty minor (or has non-gendered explanations) has been pretty good. 

That say, sexism does exist in the industry. I’ve heard anecdotes from folks at at least one other of those companies that you’ve listed (again, won’t name here, but happy to in a DM) talk about being told “ah you’re lucky you didn’t join that other team you were thinking of; the engineering director had been blocking the promotions of the female engineers under him for the past 2 years”. To this end, you *do* have to be proactive in knowing the dynamics of teams and you *do* have to be careful about the teams you chose to join. However, there are also definitely clear pockets of good people. Seeing as how being deliberate of evaluating potential coworkers for fit is something good to do anyway, it’s not too bad to add “gender attitude fit” to the evaluation mix.

No. You can never store passwords securely with reversible encryption. There are huge security flaws with doing so. Two big ones you can't ever get around, no matter how good the algorithm is:

1) If someone uses my password to do bad things, then the bank is automatically suspect. The fact that they can retrieve my password casts suspicion on the organization and all their administrators to prove that they didn't mishandle my password data, or that none of those people with access went rogue and took my data with them.

2) If the encryption is reversible then that undoubtedly means that the encryption key is stored electronically somewhere. If an attacker is savvy enough to steal a password database, they're also savvy enough to steal an encryption key as well, and suddenly they've cracked the database wide open.

There's a huge amount of liability on the bank's part for little to no benefit.

This all assumes that you're storing passwords using a reasonable encryption algorithm. But, because encryption algorithms aren't designed to store passwords, there are tons of little mistakes you can make when using them to do so. Look no farther than the infamous Adobe breach to see what kinds of things you can infer from a database of encrypted (instead of hashed+salted) passwords.

https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/11/04/anatomy-of-a-password-disaster-adobes-giant-sized-cryptographic-blunder/

For example, a savvy attacker, upon realizing that they can download the password database, could create a dozen or a hundred dummy accounts with really common passwords. Things like ""abcd1234"". Then they steal the database with their 100 dummy accounts and can see what their common passwords encrypted to. Suddenly they have access to a huge number of accounts that used those insecure passwords, because they can compare ciphertexts to see if they match.

And sure, you can start talking about salting your encrypted passwords and that stuff, but then you're basically trying to re-invent hashed and salted password storage. Why?

1. Yes, as long as the standard rules of ethical experimentation are observed. It's no different from developing a new drug or procedure.
2. Yes, if the baby is already at risk, it makes sense to try to fix the problem before birth. However, it sounds like He did it in an unethical and dishonest way.
3. Yes. There's an element of risk, but that's science for you.
4. I think researchers should be restricted by the laws of the parents' country of origin, to avoid people experimenting in international waters. The medical systems of different countries are different.
5. I don't believe in God, but humans began ""playing God"" thousands of years ago when we started planting crops. I'm not too worried about a GATTACA situation honestly. People will always find some reason to hate those who are different. The focus of the discrimination changes, but people don't change. I don't think we can justify telling people they can't spare their kids a lifetime of pain just because some other kid might get made fun of. If we can save lives, we need to push forward.
6. These kinds of modifications are not quite as defensible. I don't think it needs to be illegal, but I wouldn't do it. I think in the future it will be considered a little gauche to do that to your kids. For instance, plastic surgery is widely available today, but that doesn't mean everybody gets it.
7. It would have to be up to the parents, as advised by the doctor. Sort of like circumcision. This gets a little thorny when you consider traits like autism and Deafness, where you have adult members of a community proclaiming that there's nothing wrong with them. I think it will become one of those things that is considered rude to ask new parents about.
8. A lot of people are worried about a world full of tall blonde Aryan clones, but I think common sense will prevail there. I'm more worried about all the mistakes that scientists are going to make along the way. We've already had issues with genetically modified crops that ended up being bad for the soil.

girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:17,2022-10-09 18:13,Instigated-,Comment,Conflict with a more junior developer,irov2bo,,"I think it’s really important for us to be clear about what is meant by “imposter syndrome” versus when it is misused.

The term originated when a female psychologist noticed a pattern of high achieving women who felt insecure that they weren’t good enough despite very clear objective achievements. There was a huge gap between their high levels of competence, skill and success and their low levels of confidence.

The term has since been bastardised to be used by anyone who is feeling like they’re not good enough - including when they objectively suck, are incompetent, are lazy, etc. Is it surprising that someone who is not good at their job is afraid they are not good at their job? No. That isn’t a phenomenon.

The difference in these two uses: in one case high achieving women feel they aren’t good enough imho because women are often subjected to double standards where no matter how good they are they are questioned, taken for granted, undervalued, gaslit, thus screwing with their self perception.

Meanwhile men on average are overconfident and society has more confidence in men, which means men are more likely to be promoted above their ability and then find themselves in situations where they don’t have adequate skill, knowledge, ability or wisdom to do their job properly and thus there is a reckoning where quite rightly they fear they are not good enough because they aren’t.

In such situations it’s not uncommon for insecure men to lean on highly capable women and take credit for their work, and reap the benefits of this by continuing to be promoted beyond their ability at the expense of those women. 

It’s not anyone’s benefit to enable this cycle. If this man is struggling with basics already, it will be even worse if he is promoted to senior (where he will be expected to mentor and onboard juniors amongst other things).

While we should all help our teammates, this is only true if that help is known and the manager is aware of the situation so they don’t incorrectly credit the work or promote the wrong person.

In my company we encourage people to send their messages to the team channel so everyone can help and learn rather than private DMs. This keeps everything transparent.",2246,gendered split perception,,,think really important us clear meant imposter syndrome versus misuse term originate female psychologist notice pattern high achieve woman felt insecure good enough despite clear objective achievement huge gap high level competence skill success low level confidence term since bastardise use anyone feel like good enough include objectively suck incompetent lazy etc surprise someone good job afraid good job phenomenon difference two use one case high achieve woman feel good enough imho woman often subject double standard matter good question take grant undervalued gaslit thus screw self perception meanwhile men average overconfident society confidence men mean men likely promote ability find situation adequate skill knowledge ability wisdom job properly thus reckon quite rightly fear good enough situation uncommon insecure men lean highly capable woman take credit work reap benefit continue promoted beyond ability expense woman anyone benefit enable cycle man struggle basic already even bad promote senior expect mentor onboard junior amongst thing help teammates true help know manager aware situation incorrectly credit work promote wrong person company encourage people send message team channel everyone help learn rather private dms keep everything transparent,0.509478836,Subjective

I have had success doing this in the past, but I was spoiled and had a recruiter, so I wasn't sourcing my own candidates, I was merely dealing with the rest of the hiring pipeline.

I've recently started as the Head of Engineering at a seed-stage startup and am now responsible for _finding_ talent. At the moment I'm hoping to hire a fully remote senior engineer with frontend React expertise (I'd also love some backend experience but I'm trying not to be greedy), but given the success the company is having I suspect I'll get a chance to hire more people in the future. This leads me to my question.

Does anyone have any general advice about the best way for me to go about finding women that might be interested in this (or future) roles? I am spending a lot of time digging through LinkedIn but I suspect there is a better way. I am aware of some sites I can pay to put listings up on specifically to find women engineers, but I don't know which are best, or if they are actually worth it, or what might be the newest info about that since the last thread on this I can find by searching. 

I'm more than willing to put _time_ in and go out of my way to find these candidates however I can: wandering around in subreddits or discords or the like or just chatting with tons of people, I'm not sure!

Any and all advice would be much appreciated!

And if anyone here is even a _little_ bit interested in the role (I know it's vague in this message but think it's a good one at a very promising company and I'm happy to discuss it more in DMs), or just wants to chat, or knows anyone that fits those criteria, then please feel free to DM me and we can talk about it!",2246,gendered split perception,,,hi folk first man aware sort impose space really like apologize front say subscribe subreddit read regularly incredibly important see perspective deal work try break industry management leadership time incredibly important hire build team people diverse background life experience success past spoiled recruiter source candidate merely deal rest hire pipeline recently start head engineering seed stage startup responsible find talent moment hop hire fully remote senior engineer frontend react expertise also love backend experience try greedy give success company suspect get chance hire people future lead question anyone general advice best way go find woman might interested future roles spend lot time dig linkedin suspect good way aware sit pay put listing specifically find woman engineer know best actually worth might new info since last thread find search willing put time go way find candidate however wander around subreddits discord like chat ton people sure advice would much appreciate anyone even little bit interested role know vague message think good one promising company happy discus dm want chat know anyone fit criteria please feel free dm talk,0.431240981,Objective

I'm one of those women who started out on IBM mainframes. I've been doing this for a long, long time. I love every minute of it. 

These days, I'm mostly the HBIC. I don't get much of this stuff anymore, but I've had some rough times. What I've learned comes down to one simple thing: attitude. 

Your desk/workstation/office/cubicle is your kingdom. You don't let *anyone* who isn't your boss come into your kingdom and take over. If someone comes over to ""help"" or ""correct you"" or ""explain things"" to you, push them out. Say, ""That's very interesting. Send me an email, okay?"" If they grab your keyboard or your laptop to ""show you,"" reach over and take it back. ""Sorry, I'm on deadline. Send me an email, okay?"" If they tell you you are wrong, essentially say ""prove it""--in a nicer way, of course. If you get the absolute asshole who won't back off, you grab some papers, stand up, tell him you don't have time right now, and walk out. Bonus points if you can step on his foot or kick his leg on your way out. 

I don't give a single fuck what people say about me behind my back. If they want to call me bossy and opinionated, I don't care. I only care that I do my job and do it well. 

If I get comments to my face about time of the month, or hormones, or ...anything related to gender..., I put on my resting bitch face and say, ""I have balls bigger than yours...in a jar on my desk."" Because really, those guys are insecure little boys.

And here's the other thing: if anyone tries to screw up my work or make me look bad to my boss, I will seriously fuck them up. It may take me a while, but I'm smarter than they are. They will never see me coming. Know how I know this? Because smart, serious people don't waste their time trying to make other people look bad. Only idiots do that. 

Ninety-five percent of the people you work with will be just fine. They will be more than just fine. They will collaborate, and teach, and help you be a smarter, more skilled worker.  

The other 5% you just have to handle. But you have to remember that they are all guys and guys spend way too much time trying to be the alpha in the room. You don't need to try. You are a woman. That makes you the alpha in the room. As long as you don't forget that, you'll be just fine.

I was hired to help with customer support and training, but my role has morphed as we have doubled in size to managing our support tasks. I am mainly doing project management type work with our support tasks -making sure things are assigned and completed, working as the communicator to our customers to help gather the details of customer issues, but also communicate back when they are resolved, as well as answering our support help ticket platform. 

My direct supervisor in my last two one on one's has told me directly that I'm not qualified for my role, that someone more technical should be managing, and that he doesn't think I belong in this role. The first time he told me this he said that an employee (who is known to be unreliable at communication and accomplishing tasks) should have received my role but hadn't shown enough initiative, so I filled it. 

In the last month I've had mostly negative feedback from my him including, one of my one on one's was suppose to be 30 mins but went for nearly two hours in which I was asked the same questions over and over in different ways. It felt so degrading and I qA exasperated by the end of it. I'm feeling really frustrated to be continually told in not qualified by the person who supervises me. It seems that he is doing this because he'd prefer I do the role he had a vision for, rather than what it morphed into.

Despite him telling me I'm unqualified he is not providing evidence of where I'm doing a poor job. I've met with our CEO who about some of the mixed messages I've been getting and affirmed that he wants me in this position and that I'm doing a good job. I also have metrics to support the work I'm doing.  

I've never had such negative feedback from a supervisor. Sometimes I wonder if it has anything to do with gender in that I'm the only women in position of management. But really don't have anything to support that feeling, other than he has said that other women in the company are not doing well at their jobs because they have a confidence issue and him continuing to disempower me without evidence.  It probably more has to do with his perception of what he wants my job to be vs. what I have been tasked with, but none the less, it's making me angry.

Their job is to defend the company against lawsuits. They have no liabilty if you're hurt so its not their problem. The goal is to make it their problem by introducing financial liability to the company if you're hurt. I'll explain how generally. Countries vary.

Having experienced similar things ( sexual harassment, the death & dismemberment is a whole other level ), HR sat HIM down to explain where the lines are in terms of reducing the company's liability. They asked me pointed questions clearly making sure that the lines hadn't been crossed. I live in a country with EXTREMELY lax sexual harassment regulations ( USA ) ( side note: the former head of the agency that is supposed to regulate sex harassment was accused of sexual harassment while being nominated for the supreme court and still got it and remains there ). So, like, fuck. I think you're totally screwed on this.

If it were me, from my experience, I would ignore the sex/gender elements and bring up with HR IN WRITING that the discussions of death/dismemberment are a threat. Try to avoid softening the words. Don't say you perceive it that way. Don't say ""think"" or ""believe"" They are threats. He is threatening you. Full stop. Less words is more. Say as little as possible. Your coworker is threatening your physical safety. Quote him. That's it.

Keep everything in writing. When the company inevitably wants to chat face-to-face. Take notes. with quotes. Then email them your notes immediately after with a statement like ""Here are the notes from our discussion."" Make it very visible you are doing so. Carry a notepad with you starting immediately.

They are more likely to give you a raise with a new title than raise the salary of your current role, even though you make less than new hires - this argument seems totally fair, but it is unusual to win this one. Do not give in if they say “new title, raise later.”

Even still, this is all a long shot. Management generally only learns once the situation blows up on them. It is rare to find management that listens to the issues being raised (too much work, more responsibilities without support etc).  As far as they see it you are “happily” getting it all done - so where is the problem? I mean you may complain a little and look stressed out but why is that a bad thing for them?

Unfortunately, there	is little chance to turn this around, based on what I have seen myself and heard from friends/family about their various work predicaments and from the work culture you describe.

I would definitely go on the job hunt and next time say no to unreasonable requests. Or ask for extra compensation up front about covering two roles. The company is not your friend, don’t do favors for work, don’t be nice for the company. Many companies will overstep what they ask when they ask someone to be a team player. Remember there is likely at least one person  who barely gets any work done and what work they do barely passes for decent, they are still there. You saying “no” is not going to jeopardize your role, if anything it will garner respect.

If it is impossible to not do two roles, the manager should help you prioritize what needs to get done and what does not need to get done so you have a reasonable workload. The answer “all the things” is not acceptable, either you are in one role, the other, or being compensated for being in two roles. Let them solve the understaffing issue, don’t solve it by being “nice” or wanting to “help out” or “being a team player.”

By less stability, I mean that:

1. You're never going to find something like a union job in this field.
2. It's almost impossible in this field to advance your career without changing jobs. 
3. Especially on the programming side, the companies themselves rarely have the kind of reliable market to support the tech side of things, unless you're doing B2B software.
4. It's not that it's easy to lose your job, it's that the situation for yourself and the team and your position within the team is much more fluid than most fields. Situations *can* change rapidly, and that can lead to you no longer being needed. It's not that this happens a lot, it's just that it can happen rapidly, and at any time.

Especially with point #4, this makes it very hard to say if you'll have that job a year later compared to most jobs. It's not that people are let go more often (though that might be the case) it's that those situations are less predictable.

Getting into this field is great money, and very rewarding. Use that money to save up your own unemployment fund, get comfortable with looking for new job every 2-5 years, and it'll probably be a very positive move. 

Don't use the extra money to increase your lifestyle until you've saved an emergency fund (in fact, I'd highly suggest visiting r/personalfinance and following their flow chart). If you follow this advice, you'll give yourself the cushion to deal with the *kind* of instability I'm talking about, and that issue will be mostly mitigated.

Most companies in this field are less likely to fire people in my experience. They'd rather try and teach you and train you, since it's really expensive for them to replace you. (This applies only if you're a W2 employee, if you're a 1099 contractor, you have absolutely zero stability in this field.) It's the fact that circumstances are unpredictable and change rapidly that make it unstable, and that doesn't apply to every business or every industry.

I've had programming jobs in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Portland, and have interviewed and explored jobs in Seattle and San Francisco. I'm currently in Portland, and actually am trying to fill a position right now, but it's for a very senior position.

So, the first thing I want to say is, you sound like you've got a lot more of a handle on this than you give yourself credit for. Impostor syndrome sucks. :( There are hundreds of things you have to keep track of at any given time, and sometimes a thing or two will temporarily slip. It doesn't feel great, but it happens. 

About the script with errors - it sounds like you found the problem yourself and raised it up as soon as you did. That's responsibility right there! You reacted to it when you noticed, and brought it up with those who needed to know. This kind of thing happens sometimes, and I bet you'll check sooner going forward!

Little fixes after the fact are also pretty common, especially if you don't have full mastery of a codebase. (Which sometimes isn't even possible!) As time goes on you get better at foreseeing risky changes, but you can't catch everything. I still need to make small fixes semi-often, and I'm at a decade of experience. What's important is that you're aware of it and get it done! 

It does get better, but some of it will be a mindset shift. I think you're realizing this already, based on what you said about dealing with ""failures"" in a light-hearted way. That's really key actually! Software is \_hard\_, especially web-based software. 

I'm not sure about the environment you're working in, so this next bit may not apply. It helped me to realize that not every comment on a pr/change is a failure, nor every problem pointed out by a coworker. In the best working cultures I've been in, those are actually ways we help each other succeed. While it might not feel great to have issues pointed out, it's much better we find them than a customer. 

It also really helped me to look at the reviews of some of my more senior coworkers' code and realize they would point out issues on each others changes, without it being personal. Sometimes one senior person would point out an issue, and the other might respond: ""thank you! that would have caused a big problem"" and fix it. I'd then see another review with their roles reversed, and the same conversations. They might also have an in-depth conversation about it where they both came out with a better understanding.

Are the kids older? Do they need childcare? If so, try to see if you can get some government help with that. Take any government help you can, especially for health insurance.

Scholarships are great... You might be eligible for grants. I know that it is best not to take out student loans, but it will be a big boon. Apply for scholarships even if it's not much money. Apply sooner rather than later.

Now I went to state school not WGU. How I paid for school was I got a full-time job at the school and they paid for it. It was only part-time school though. It took me a while to get my degree... If it is at all feasible, I would try to go full time school and get it over with, but don't discount part-time school if you can't do FT.

If you can, if you can get study buddies that will be a HUGE help. Like a class group chat or something. Being able to reach out to get unblocked on something is big. And try to get started on school work as soon as you can, in case you get stuck and need help. Lastly, partial credit. If you're staring at a deadline and can't finish it with a good job, I have gotten a surprising amount of credit for doing an ok job instead.

Another is find an organization system that works for you. I put deadlines in my calendar (and later bujo). There is no way I can remember everything and I needed something to nudge me in the right way when I got zombie brain. This should also help you prioritize tasks. Folks with a lot of stuff on their plate and also succeed are masters at knowing what to put off and what to do NOW.

Find a way to file your papers good. I have a paper tray with the following trays:

* Incoming: drop everything in here that needs to be processed.
* To do: things that need action from me, like bills to be paid
* File: things that I need to put in my filing system

Lastly, stay on top of those bills! Fees will eat you alive. Make sure to not pay late. Minimum payment is better than none at all. Payment plans instead of burying your head in the sand.

Something very similar happened to me, I had a mental breakdown in front of my female manager and  suddenly I was taken off of most work, not given anything of value to do and suddenly deemed untrustworthy. It was hell and I could feel my career going to crap. She would constantly belittle me in front of the team, and was passive aggressive. Slowly I stopped getting 1:1s. 

The company I was at was supposedly progressive too but frankly the progressiveness was just bs pandering. 
Start documenting your interactions with them, record them using your phone and gather evidence. Raise a grievance with your evidence, and highlight that you've been treated differently since you had the breakdown. This is discrimination and make sure you treat it as such. If you're part of a union, make sure you talk to them and if you're not, now is a great time to join. 

Make sure you begin documenting all of the bullying too. Raise it with your manager and if nothing happens, keep building the evidence. I'm not sure which country you're based in but make notes/logs of everything. Make sure that this evidence is NOT stored on your work computer. Take pictures if you have to, but you can be shut out at a moment's notice. 

Don't start the grievance until you've compiled all your evidence. HR is there to protect the company at all cost, not you, no matter how progressive they may seem. 

Best case your union can help you get a settlement. Worst case you get fired because of this treatment. Having a union will help protect you from the latter, and make sure you listen to the union rep on how to effectively manage this. 

Any 1:1s you go into from now on record it. Any time you have to work with this douche, record it. You are allowed to make recordings for personal use without telling anyone. (At least in the UK, double check that this applies to the US). 

Progressiveness will always be secondary to profit. Companies pretending to be progressive will use this as a way to guilt/gaslight/manipulate employees. 
I promise you there are other companies that are just as 'progressive'. Maybe look into ESG software companies.

Just look at the backlash that every female ref or sportscaster has to deal with in addition to just doing their job.  They get death threats.  If that's not hostile, I don't know what is.  


Are there any women in your organization who are visible to the outside or does it just show men, men, and more men?  Can any women go on recruiting trips or is it just you, a man and I'm guessing a male ex-softball coach?  


While your testing and interviewing may not have bias, that doesn't matter much if the process of initial recruitment doesn't get them to enter the process and clearly if you're getting such low numbers of women applying, that's where the failure is happening. So you're right, it's systemic and as a single hiring manager you can't fix the fact that the fanbase is so disgustingly misogynistic that they successfully chase off any women considering a career in professional sports, even if they are not public facing positions.  


And so what if Glassdoor shows great ratings?  Do you think the OP's company would have had Glassdoor reviews telling people about sexism when the team has never had a woman let alone a woman of color on the team before?  An all male environment isn't going to leave reviews warning future employees about sexual harassment issues because there won't be any until women are finally working there.  


Basically, I have to roll my eyes when people tell me that they want to have a more equal representation but they don't actually go out of their way to ensure that the missing demographic knows that it's safe to apply.  You can't just keep doing things the exact same way as before and expect that results will magically change.  You may be missing out on better recruits because you're not investing the time and energy it takes to make it abundantly clear that they're wanted.  A letter blindly delivered to a coach via usps feels very hands off and indifferent.  A face to face meeting, even if it's just showing off to drop the letter off in person and say hi and introduce yourself and do some handshakes could literally make all the difference.  And sure, maybe that's how you've always done it whether it's softball or baseball, but obviously the men already know that they're safe and desired for the position, the women do not.

Interrupting is annoying, but someone who won't admit when they are wrong and blames other people will endanger all the work you need to do with them. I agree this isn't unusual to encounter someone like this. Maybe he's an OK person, but I wouldn't want to build software with him.

It could be she asked for this, but it doesn't explicitly say that and it sounds more like it was the manager's idea.

Why are you holding her to such a high standard? No one wants to listen to someone who is constantly interrupting and talking over them.

[Chart and discussion here](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2015/01/10/chart-of-the-week-what-happened-to-women-in-computer-science/)

The short of it is that back when it was mechanical adding machines and slide rules ""computing"" was designated as women's work, because it's kinda secretarial, I dunno I guess.  

When programmable computing machines started to become important for engineering work, programming and operating them fell to women.  But home computers were marketed heavily as a father-son activity (many early ones were built from kits, like kit radios) and this lead to more young men going to school with some awareness of BASIC and assembly.  Then because sexism and laziness, schools confused prior experience with ability and didn't bother to accommodate novices.  So when the web bubble happened, it was mostly men getting rich.  A locker-room culture of acceptable sexual harassment emerged.  The gamer-to-tech pipeline solidified.  Women were and are further discouraged from programming careers by the reasonable fear that we'll be treated like crap.

Women are perfectly capable.  In my high school experience, young women were very much over-represented in math team and the top-track math classes, even though I went to a recently integrated school that had been all-boys only a few years previously.

I'm still seriously considering an engineering or engineering-tech career.  (Surveying?  Yeah, that sounds really appealing.)  But for me personally, overcoming a lot of misogyny, and ugly experiences with harassment, is *still* a personal challenge.  I'm not eager to generalize my experiences to women as a broad category - I'm trans and it was more often ""you can't be a girl because you like STEM"" than ""you can't like STEM because you're a girl"", but whichever way those prejudices slice I have become very much aware of them.  It's *amazing* what chauvinists will say when they think no women are listening.

Or I guess to state it more precisely: I started a career as a skilled repair worker and it was clear that I was expected to accept degrading and marginalizing women. (They treated bars and strip clubs as a kind of initiation ritual, for example.)  I was supposed to be ""one of the boys.""

Do you have any general tips on tech interviews?",ifgjao7,,"I interview a lot of engineers, from the “will they fit ok in our department?” view, while my colleague does the technical. Here are my tips.

1. Diffuse the adrenaline that builds up shortly before the interview. Do this by intensive exercise, or calming tablets. If you’re remote, spend 5 minted running up and down stairs just before the interview (catch your breath!). If in person, go for a very brisk walk around the block to burn off the butterflies. 

I’ve used Kalms over the counter calming tablets, chamomile tea. 

2. Practice! Get some tech friends to set up as many mock interviews as possible. If it can be with someone you don’t know well, even better! You can find online a bunch of “questions for Java developers” and your friends can just read them out - the point is *to get used* to *thinking quickly, staying calm, and speaking to strangers*.

3. Prepare! Remind yourself of all the good things you’ve done by sittting down and writing a list of examples of your work - and your behaviour at work. E.G. 

- prepare 2 examples of a time when you had to use your own initiative to get a job finished. 

-Examples of things you’ve learned by your own research online (Pluralsight? Linkedin Learning? Certifications?) 

- Think of a couple of your _mistakes_ too- and what you learned from them. This is handy for those sneaky  “what are your weaknesses? “ questions. 

Having said that - some interviews ARE  just very technical (how would you approach creating an XUZ? ) so the thing to do here is practice practice practice with the technical interview questions mentioned above. 

4.Don’t be TOO calm! Show some excitement! Check out the company website; when it gets to the bit where you can ask questions, say “I see you do ABC, sounds interesting, can you give me some more detail?” 

5. More good questions to ask the interviewer:

- ask what the company does to promote social bonds between the teams. Are the team activities strongly gendered? All beer, mountain climbing and violent gaming, or more like bowling, DnD and less, well, “tech bro”. (A shout out to r/girlsgonewired for suggesting this question, a while back) It’s a good insight into the company culture! 

- size and make up of the teams.

- what opportunities do they offer you in training and career development? (e.g. would the company pay for your next -level Java certification exam?)

Computer security has come a long way. Some very basic, universal principles have been formed in the industry, which include things like an online company that deals with user logins and passwords (any site, like amazon) do not store the actual password in the server without proper protection, do not rely on security through obscurity (don't assume that just because a core security backdoor is unusual or hard to find, it won't be found), etc.

A website that complies with the first principle would NOT be able to show you your password, even if they wanted to. Their website admin can go to the backend and look at the stored information, but nothing that shows up there will look like your password. It can only process your password when you enter it, but it doesn't mean it ""saves"" it (in the layman's sense of the word). But usually customers will want  to see their password, and will nag customer support to no end to just ""show them the password"" because ""they are showing to the customer itself, so why the needless security protections"". 

If the website budges and GIVES you your password, it means it CAN give you the password, which means that *its security is shit*. It's ""i just learned how to program, and made up a password entry method from scratch without thinking of long term consequences"" level shit. It means it doesn't have competent programmers on staff. Its programmers never ever read a single book or pamphlet or online tutorial on how to build a secure system involving passwords.

It's the equivalent of a hotel where management is so stupid that keeps all its room keys in the parking lot, in an unlocked cabinet, which the hotel thinks is safe because it keeps a guard posted next to it, but doesn't realize that the guard gets off shift at night and goes home with the keys hanging there exposed.

First, don't go to a hotel like that. 

If you have to go, make sure the password you give them is not the same password you use in other secure sites. Heck, they deserve to be given the word ""password"" as their password.

And God forbid they try to keep your credit card information.

Run while you can.

You raise an interesting point, but I would like to argue that nobody is missing out on anything. Your given examples indicate both a choice and a behavioural trait, which obviously affects the outcome. Finding something uncomfortable (again, given examples about an unbiased environment) and choosing not to pursue it will render the talent in the matter effectively worthless, while toughing out through the uncomfortable is handled differently by individuals and again can affect the outcome (+ or -).

> I don't even know if there is a solution to this problem, but I feel like we're not doing as well as we could be.

If this statement is a continuation of the unbiased environment not achieving the optimal outcome, can it even be considered a problem then, since perhaps accepting the fact that anyone's interests or preferences might be treated differently by their peers and the economy itself is perfectly alright (again, in that unbiased non-hostile way). If ""this problem"" refers to the actual possible issues discussed and studied world-wide and predominantly in this thread, you might want to skip the rest of this comment since I don't (and don't want to) address that.

The situation you illustrated and the conclusion you gave would (in my opinion, obviously) correlate more deeply with psychological, behavioural and other social analyses. Aswell, wouldn't artifically nurturing an environment to a desired outcome subsequent to removing all anomalous obstacles (after achieving the so called unbiased environment) probably bring it all back to the very starting point?

In any case, I suppose that what should come *after* treating possible interferences is simply **acceptance of the result despite what it actually is**. Advocating for more could be vengeful, arrogant, greedy or any other negative implication, specifically which depends on the actual matter and processes before it, because it definitely affirmates that all the reasonings and lobbying were made in bad faith or blind pursuit.

I left PhD #1 in field A due to violence, jumped into PhD #2.1 in field B because I was afraid to work in field A again, then went back to field A starting PhD #2.2. 

Has anyone had experience with this? I don’t want to look unreliable because if anything I’m super committed to achieving my goals given what I had to face.

I can’t really say I “worked” for the PhD #1 guys because they might just call up the PhD #1 guys and ask them about me.

=========================================
Backstory:

* PhD #1: left after being physically attacked by colleague. After reporting I was severely bullied and called lazy because I wouldn’t work alone at night as my attacker could have easy access to me. Nothing happened to the guy, everyone felt so sorry for him because some crazy lady couldn’t get over the fact he’d just made a small mistake by attacking me that one time.I experienced other forms of sexual harassment almost daily. FYI my attacker was known for his violence by the “low status people”, but I was the only one to report him.

* PhD #2.1: got funding to work in slightly different field - took it to escape and not give up my dream of a PhD. Nice folks, but the work was a cinch and I missed my old field. Met head of school from undergrad major who said I could come back anytime and he’d make it happen. I couldn’t resist.

* PhD#2.2: what I should’ve done in PhD #1. It was hell, but no one attacked me so I could do it. Met rape survivors, had a professor viciously call me a “fucking bitch” because I stopped talking to him after he said creepy sexual stuff to me, other guys said creepy stuff to me all the time, was told girls are shit, was bullied and watched colleagues bullied every day (our senior researcher liked to tell us how shit we were), had female colleagues confessed they cried daily in the toilets (who doesn’t?) and so, so much more.

In a less dangerous field you are safer, less prone to injury, probably do less physical labour, being incredibly valuable at 50 when your knee's arent gone.

You seem isolate everything about money. Happiness, satisfaction etc are factors not even considered. You want all the benefits of a job, without any of the risks. You want the big salary, without the stressful responsibility that justifies that salary. Why should those professions be paid more? In what capacity do they deserve the higher pay? How do you justify that?

Our society values work. And high risk hard work or work with high responsibility or knowledge required is valued higher than low risk work or simple work. This isn't just true for dangerous physical jobs like welding or construction ,but also for high external risk jobs like being a surgeon. High risk = higher pay. A boss for a company makes more because big financial decisions for both the company and all it's employee's are his responsibility, when they are good decisions he profits massively ,but if they are not he loses big time. As a simple employee you get paid regardless of what happens at the time, you're relatively risk free. Your responsibility ends when you close the door and go home.

>that makes  my point even stronger that female dominated professions should not be paid less than male dominated professions.

The gender of the employee shouldn't come into the equation at all. Why should we base pay on the predominant gender in a field. Would that mean we should pay a female dominated profession less when the increase in pay results in a big increase of men, who figure out they can do a much safer job for the same pay? Or are you saying all field woman choose should be paid higher in general? And in that line of thinking ,what are we doing to get more women into construction? Even with the current higher pay for more difficult or responsible work we see many women CHOOSE not to go that route. Paying them more to remain where they are will only worsen the unequal distribution of gender in different fields.

The financial rewards are a incentive to make people do otherwise dangerous or hard jobs. If you aren't willing to take that risk, OR if the financial reward isn't important enough to choose that profession, as it seems for many women, then why is that a problem?

I just started a master’s program in the social sciences (have a BA in the same) and I had felt strongly for the past year or so (before starting) that I needed to get a PhD and become a professor. I was working in admin support roles before this and felt unfulfilled/not respected for a couple of years.

I also did this program to get more clarity and to learn quantitative methods for social sciences, since I don’t have a strong background in that. I do love the field I study, but I’ve realized over the past month or so that this path would make my life way more unstable - i.e. difficulty even finding a non-adjunct job, being far away from my boyfriend and family when i want to settle down, the disrespectfully low pay. 

I’m realizing that learning computer programming / data analytics while still in my current program would be a good pathway for me to transition into a more stable career that is still intellectually stimulating and has better hours (i would not aim for FAANG given my lack of background) + better prospects for my short and long-term finances.

Emotionally, I do feel kind of guilty for realizing how much more important financial/family stability is to me than feeling intellectually validated by others in an academic career. 

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice for how to transition into CS from a social sciences (or non-STEM) background? I want to finish my MA and take stats and maybe learn Python here, but I’m not sure what the best path forward is. Should I do an online post bacc (Tufts, OSU) or do a boot camp and hope to find an internship afterwards? Or just any advice/support would be really appreciated. 💗

TL;DR: Doing a social sciences MA and now realizing I want to pursue CS for the stability/career prospects, but I lack the necessary educational background + skills 🙁 Know some basic HTML and learning Javascript; I like it and find the problem-solving enjoyable.

It's sustainable only for a short time. In the end you end with mental breakdown. I would not recommend. I tried to work from home with kids when they were sick (too sick for daycare, but healthy enough so they jump all over the place at home). I.e one week at home, 2 weeks at daycare. My younger was 1.5y at the time. After 2-3 months of that, I realized I am going toward mental burnout, I got into really bad place mentally. So I started taking sick leave (I live in Europe, so it's paid and unlimited). After some time, my company suggested that I needed to switch jobs, because I was too unreliable. It's really common with small kids. I did switch companies in the end.

When my younger kid was 3y old, it became much easier to work (full time) from home with him, i.e. when he's sick. Still, after 3-4 days of that, it becomes very hard and mentally draining. You won't be able to do your work properly, and you won't be able to take care of the kid(s) properly. You'll probably let them watch cartoons for several hours, just to ""finish something in peace"" or ""just for this meeting"", and you'll still be interrupted. And the problem with scrum master is that you'll probably lead meetings, lots of them. I can easily listen to a meeting, muted, with kids in the background, but to actively participate, hell no.

Sometimes, on really slow Fridays (no long meetings, straightforward programming or writing docs, no learning new stuff or deep debugging), I leave my kids intentionally at home (younger is 4 now). They are old enough to play on their own, and enjoy the day off from daycare, so I usually can concentrate on my work. My current company is supporting, if anyone's kid gets into virtual meeting, people usually say hi and talk with them, it's really nice.

However, working from home with kids in daycare/preschool is great! Especially for us mothers (who usually hold the most of mental load for the household, statistically, not to say unfortunately about chores and actual stuff). I am more productive, and when I need a pause from work, I can take a quick nap or make dinner, or go for a run/bike ride. I am more productive and happier. But the kids need to be gone from home. I.e. having a partner/nanny who will take care of kids in another room probably won't help much, because the kids know you're at home and they'll come knocking on your door occasionally. Even when you explain to them 20x, many days in a row, that you have a important meeting now and please don't disturb me :D",2563,gendered split perception,,,work home small kid usually hell sustainable short time end end mental breakdown would recommend tried work home kid sick sick daycare healthy enough jump place home e one week home 2 week daycare young 1 5y time 2 3 month realize go toward mental burnout get really bad place mentally start take sick leave live europe pay unlimited time company suggest needed switch job unreliable really common small kid switch company end young kid 3y old become much easy work full time home e sick still 3 4 day becomes hard mentally drain able work properly able take care kid properly probably let watch cartoon several hour finish something peace meeting still interrupt problem scrum master probably lead meeting lot easily listen meeting muted kid background actively participate hell sometimes really slow friday long meeting straightforward program write doc learn new stuff deep debugging leave kid intentionally home young 4 old enough play enjoy day daycare usually concentrate work current company support anyone kid get virtual meeting people usually say hi talk really nice however work home kid daycare preschool great especially us mother usually hold mental load household statistically say unfortunately chore actual stuff productive need pause work take quick nap make dinner go run bike ride productive happier kid need go home e partner nanny take care kid another room probably help much kid know home come knock door occasionally even explain 20x many day row important meeting please disturb,0.473738054,Objective

Separating them is extremely rare, because, well, mainly because that's how it's always been.

Under Windows and OSX, you also typically obtain your software by downloading it from the software vendors web site.

On a phone, every app gets its own sandbox to play in (yes, that's actually the technical term). Also, the system will not let them access certain things like the camera without you giving permission. That means that even if you download malware, it can't really do much: It can't access data stored by other apps, access your camera etc. (Unless it manages to break out of the sandbox, which is not easy and requires an unpatched security issue in the sandbox.)

You also can't (easily) download random software off the Internet - and putting malware into the Play/Apple store means that Google/Apple *might* find it before you can infect many users (though the reviews are no guarantee!) This makes the initial infection much harder, since the attacker can't just tell you an ad telling you to download the newest flash player.

Additionally, the sandbox concept, combined with the fact that each phone has its own specific operating system and all phones of that type are exactly identical, means that it's very easy to know what the state outside of the sandboxes is supposed to look like. Thus, the phone can be built to make it very hard to change anything outside, making it harder for the malware to break out of its sandbox (and stay alive there even when the phone reboots). An operating system for a PC has to run on many different configurations of hardware, the user will install low-level drivers, and everything messes with everything, which makes it really hard to tell which changes were supposed to happen, and which ones were done by something malicious.


Nothing technical (aside from the driver issue that could be worked around) stops you from building an operating system for computers that works like the one on phones, except that it will be unknown, nobody will use it because it has no apps, and nobody will write apps for it because nobody uses it... there are attempts to make this work with existing software, but there isn't enough demand for secure solutions to make them work well, and the ones that build them typically target the ultra-paranoid, which results in very secure solutions that are impossible to use for the average person, eat lots of resources, don't allow you to do many things, etc.",2572,gendered split perception,,,normal computer application default access file also microphone camera separate extremely rare well mainly always windows osx also typically obtain software download software vendor web site phone every app get sandbox play yes actually technical term also system let access certain thing like camera without give permission mean even download malware really much access data store apps access camera etc unless manages break sandbox easy require unpatched security issue sandbox also easily download random software internet put malware play apple store mean google apple might find infect many user though reviews guarantee make initial infection much hard since attacker tell ad telling download new flash player additionally sandbox concept combine fact phone specific operate system phone type exactly identical mean easy know state outside sandbox suppose look like thus phone build make hard change anything outside make hard malware break sandbox stay alive even phone reboots operate system pc run many different configuration hardware user install low level driver everything mess everything make really hard tell change suppose happen one do something malicious nothing technical aside driver issue could work around stop build operating system computer work like one phone except unknown nobody use apps nobody write apps nobody use attempt make work exist software enough demand secure solution make work well one build typically target ultra paranoid result secure solution impossible use average person eat lots resource allow many thing etc,0.479191642,Objective

Ask me anything!",ipht6lb,,"Where I wound up career-wise is just a totally random set of things.  I never was a ""take things apart"" kind of person, though I liked logic problems.  My first introduction to computers was when a high school teacher noticed a computer programming class at a nearby college, signed a few of us up, drove us over there, waited for the class to be over, and drove us home.  Teachers are awesome...Anyway, before that I always realized I would be the top student in the class at any science/math class.  (I wasn't even happy about that.  My fantasy at the time was that some boy would do better than me at some math/science thing and my plan was to fall in love with him and marry him).  But anyway, when I walked into the class the other students were bragging about how they'd built ham radios when they were 7.  I had no idea what a ""ham radio"" was.  Anyway, my mind shut down and I convinced myself I was so far behind I'd never catch up, and didn't learn anything from that class.  

&#x200B;

So after that, if you asked me what I was interested in, I'd say ""Anything! As long as it doesn't involve computers"".  

So I majored in math.  Then I went to grad school.  I completed everything that I knew how to do (all the classes and exams).  But then I had to do a thesis.  MIT math department, at least at the time, was extremely non-helpful.  You had to find your own advisor.  My perception was that everyone else was in  grad school because ""they were smart"", whereas I only got in, and got such good grades, because ""I studied hard"".  Anyway, I was shy and insecure, and knocked on a few professors' doors and said ""I need an advisor"".  And all of them said ""Well, I'm very busy and important"". 

So an old friend happened by and asked if I was enjoying grad school.  I said ""Not really.  I have no idea how to find an advisor and start on a thesis.""  He said ""Oh, come join our group"" and that was at BBN at the dawn of networking, doing routing [protoco](https://protoco.ls)ls for the packet radio net.  And I loved it.

10 years after dropping out, I did go back and complete my PhD, this time in computer science. 

I still hate computers, by the way...

And what I tell people afraid to get into the field.  If you think you are different from  the stereotype of engineers...that means you are valuable!  If you understand people...if you can make something beautiful...if you can explain things coherently...these are valuable skills.

In college and early in my career, I often felt insecure about my lack of knowledge compared to how I perceived my peers. It seemed like for many of them, tech was not just a job but also a culture, with its own language and history and current events, and I was not a native of that culture. Even when I was dealing with teenage boys, they already spoke a different language, and when I started working and talking to people who had been at the company for decades, I felt like I could never catch up. I still feel like that sometimes when I talk to programmer friends about projects they are working on. But at some point I came to a very important realization that helped me a lot:

You will never have all of the knowledge.

This is not because there is anything wrong with you. It's because the tech world is enormous.  There are more programming languages, more libraries in those languages, more functions in those libraries, more algorithms and standards, and more ideas for how to manage and organize technical projects, than any human being could memorize in ten lifetimes. Even if you somehow knew all of it, the tech world expands exponentially every year like the big bang, fueled by an explosion of eager young thinkers and open source projects. Let go of the desire to hold all of it in your brain at once. You will never know even 1% of the sum total of cool tech things that people are working on. And -- this is the important bit -- neither will anyone else.

Luckily, we are alive during a magical time when knowledge is practically free. Don't know what something is? Look it up. Post on a help website. Ask someone. Be unapologetic. You've just started a new job, of course there will be holes in your knowledge. They're not going to judge you, and if they do, fuck 'em. Skill will overtake knowledge in the long run every time. Skill is being able to download a brand new library you've never heard of, poke around in the documentation, and build something from it anyway. I used to worry and feel intimidated about things like not knowing C#, or agile programming, or what exactly a neural net was. Now that I've built several new products almost singlehandedly, I just feel kind of zen about it. Maybe those things will come up in my career in the future, maybe not. If they do, I'll figure it out.

The bully doesn't typically cause anyone to be fired and will quite often lie about being concerned with the well being of their staff in public, however, instead of actually standing up for their staff or acting like team leaders they create a culture that drives morale down and those with real skills leave to places that will value them.  Other bullies start to rise into similar positions, not through value or skill but because they're the only personality type that can handle another bully.  Ultimately, attrition rises as morale at the lowest levels tanks and the only remaining staff are either ""stuck in a dead-end job"" and don't perform very well or they become bullies themselves and learn to emulate their own bully managers and repeat the cycle.

As an example, I have worked under an IT Manager that is a classic bully.  His M.O. is to do nothing useful until a crisis arises, often due to his own laziness or lack of planning.  He will exclude all staff from meetings with consultants and any ideas generated by staff are either stolen or dismissed as ""stupid"".  All communication of plans for the purposes of getting approvals and budgets will be entirely himself and no one else is to know or talk about the plan beyond the ""need to know"" for their role.  The resulting ""plans"" if you can call them that are as poorly thought-out as you might expect from this sort of ""single minded"" planning.  The inevitable fall out of the bad plan falls on the staff, who must make it work or ""performance reviews"" will result in poor performance and no raise.  The bully takes all credit for success and puts blame for all failure on the staff.  You might ask how this guy continues to have a job and rise up. The answer to that is mainly that the managerial level is well insulated against complaints. How do you complain about your own boss to his boss without creating bigger problems for yourself? As long as you make him look good by making his terrible plans succeed you get to keep your job and have a regular cost-of-living pay raise but you learn nothing, experience zero growth and become a mindless drone in a dead-end job...or you leave.  The result is a staff with low morale, low productivity and zero loyalty to the company.

I was shocked when I moved to a new company and saw my boss completely plastered at a conference's networking event and was incredibly embarrassed for him.  I don't think it is professional in the slightest.  With that being said, I don't know the culture of this conference so some of my tips might be irrelevant, but in general, these are some tips I have picked up from conferences:  


* Talk to your boss about your discomfort and teammates if that is appropriate. It's okay to let some co-workers know you don't want to drink.  But it is just as okay to 'NOT' tell your coworkers you don't want to drink.  I do both.  I have a few trusted coworkers that are aware, there are many coworkers who don't know and would be shocked if you told them.  It's nice to have a few people in your corner, but depending on the person sometimes it's better not to go into it.  Tell someone you trust.
* The bartenders are very happy to make you a non-alcoholic drink, oftentimes free of charge. Sometimes the bartender has some really awesome non-alcoholic drinks up their sleeve.  If they aren't sure what to make you, a sprite with a splash of cranberry and pineapple or sweet and sour are very good and have a nice, mixed drink look, put it in a fancy glass if you want.  Just slowly sip on it so it lasts you a while and you are golden.
* Know your boundaries and stick with them.  I've had people put drinks in my hand insisting that I take a shot with them, etc.  I just give it back and say ""no thank you"".  If they insist ""You have to!"" just look them dead in the eye and say ""No, I don't.""  You get to choose what you put into your body, not someone else.  It may be intimidating for you to learn how to stick to your boundaries at first, but you are a boss babe and it's great experience for developing leadership skills.
* If you ever feel unsafe, listen to that warning.  Don't go to any event or put yourself into a condition that makes you feel unsafe.  
* Personally, I attend networking socials because I feel obligated.  But I make a few quick rounds then leave early.  There gets a point in the night where people start getting drunk and it makes no difference whether you are there or not.  No one will remember.
* You can arrange a client dinner or other event rather than attend the conference social.  Get a group of clients and coworkers to go try one of Vegas's amazing restaurants or concerts or other sightseeing options.  You don't have to stick to the conference agenda to network.  Our company will often ditch out to have intimate time with the clients.

I honestly feel I have to check myself because I feel a bit resentful towards these guys sometimes. Therefore the request for some perspective cause I don't want to be unfair.

These guys have what I consider some poor work ethics: they can be very dry, borderline rude when responding to questions, are usually late to meetings or don't accept them and don't show up, they take forever to complete their tasks and won't proactively do their work, I have to always be reminding them of their own tasks even though I'm not an engineer.

Sometimes they delay deadlines or reduce the time other non-engineer team members will have to do their work if their work comes after the engineering side. They don't involve me in meetings about the project even tho I'm their boss and apologise then do it again. They gossip and make comments about people not being smart or that managers (all women) do nothing all day. For them to do something you need to praise them and talk about how intelligent they are.

They sometimes comment on videogames they play during work hours and if there's nothing urgent they simply chill and do nothing unless you explicitely ask them. 

The country where I live is pretty good with work laws, so given that they grew up here they might be more chill about work, which is a cultural thing. But I think sometimes they take it too far! 

I'm not so good with engineering yet so I feel sometimes I have to interrogate them to decipher their work, they don't meet me half way in trying to communicate in a non-technical or even just less-technical way. And they somehow expect that I will understand their riddles of code they've been working on for weeks in the 20 min meeting we have to discuss an issue.

I feel a general lack of empathy for the work of others and over emphasis on themselves. I've had other members of my team have to do overtime because some of them took forever to complete their work before a deadline, but during all of that time said they were fine, things were fine and didn't need any help. So I don't get what was the delay about.

It sounds to me like there's more going on for you than just a sucky job (and it does sound a little on the sucky side but I'll get to that). Your first list says to me that you could use some resources on mental health so I've attached some at the bottom. Absolutely no shame in that btw :)

As for your job, I'm going to be honest here, you're not in an unusual position, but that doesn't mean that it's reasonable. It sounds like you're experiencing stress and difficulty and just that is enough to say that it's not a good fit for you right now. The question then becomes, what can you do to change it and is that worth it?

Here are my suggestions:

1. Outline 3-5 courses of action you could take. 
2. Evaluate the risks of each those.
3. If any of them are worth it to you. Take those steps.

If none of them are, that's totally ok! It's entirely possible that things will just get better, especially if this is more due to external circumstances than your job. 

Here's an example of my process:

Courses of Action:

1. Quit and find a new job
2. Lay down boundaries at work and stick to them
   1. E.g. I don't answer calls after 4PM. 1-3PM are my quiet hours and I don't accept meetings or calls during that time. I can only take urgent tickets, junior devs will take all others.
3. Ask for a promotion so you're at least paid more for all this stress.
4. Set up a mentoring program so the junior devs know who to go to (that isn't you). Use this program to get your own mentor. 
5. Take a sudden vacation so people realize how valuable you are.

Risks:

1. Lots of work and no guarantee you'll find something better
2. If your work is unreasonable you could get fired (worst case scenario) or make some enemies of people who are used to you doing everything.
3. You could get rejected
4. Lots of work for potentially no reward
5. You could make some enemies

Take those steps

\- You've got this and you can take it from here!

Whatever you decide, I wish you all the luck in the world.

Congress just snuck it into the must-pass omnibus package.,dw3fexe,,"It is surprising that such a bill is even necessary. I'm absolutely behind the proposition that a new bill and its voting date has to be published at least a week beforehand (and even so, who will read a 2300-page document at a week's notice?).

The idea that any passage must first cite the law it will modify, then the modification and then the modified version is good, but I wonder how to deal with that when a text touches on several laws.

The idea that members of Congress have to sign an affidavit that they have listened or read the entirety of the text seems superfluous to me. What consequences if they haven't? It is not that a lawmaker can say after the fact that he didn't read it and the law gets repealed. And if he says so, tough luck.

I actually don't expect an doctor from Virginia to personally read a 2300-page document dealing with computer science. I expect him to have legal aides who understand the legalese and technical advisors who understand the subject who work through the document and discuss the topics that matter with him. No single congressman can understand all of the topics of the bills he votes on, and he doesn't necessarily have a background in  law either.

The last three paragraphs are disturbing. They open the way to annul any law arbitrarily after any amount of time on a formality. A 2300-page document is bound to have some errors, the humans who deal with it are bound to make errors in the process. In the interest of the public trust in the legal system, a bill once that it gets voted on and takes effect should generally be and stay law until repealed, and not open to be retracted on a technicality at any given moment.

Furthermore, I don't understand why the bill includes the passage that anybody can seek damages from the government for not obeying the text of this bill. 

First, the government needs to be able to decide in the interest of the people, even if it does damage to some, without being sued. It should be able to outlaw tobacco or coal once science has determined that they endanger innocent people and nobody should be allowed to make a profit from that. It doesn't anyways, but it should.

Secondly, why this bill specifically? Members of Congress have immunity so they can't be persecuted personally for voting for a flawed bill. If a crooked member of congress wanted one of his constituents to gain from a legal process and get a law repealed they'd just intentionally have to sneak in a non compliance error and the law gets repealed and the constituent get a compensation, and everybody else is arguably worse off than before.

The Internet is in effect a public utility. The FCC may not be classifying that way anymore, but to the public, especially younger voters and millennials, that's what it is. It's virtually impossible in American society to meaningfully participate in the economy *without* access to the Internet. You can certainly have a life without it, but that requires a lot more self-sufficiency. For most people, it's just a non-starter. (Of course this statement disregards the extremely poor in America, but their biggest priority is hardly net neutrality, and they're not very politically active due to their circumstances.)

This matters for a very simple reason: you can choose to watch less cable TV or get by with fewer channels. You cannot choose to ""use less Internet"" because you have absolutely no control over the size of a website that you *may not have a choice* but to visit.

Now you might say ""Duh that's the point, that's why they're lobbying for all this stuff."" But once this stuff starts hitting voters' wallets, they'll be pissed, and candidates who promise to restore net neutrality will start winning votes. The Democratic Party have already made net neutrality part of their platform, and they're only getting more vocal about it with the recent repeal.

Why didn't this happen with cable? Simple: everyone thought TV was a vice. ""If cable companies are gouging you, then stop watching TV and go outside, spend time with your family, etc."" It was a pretty simple mentality, largely accepted by society, and not really invalid either. You didn't need cable TV to participate in society. It was purely optional entertainment. You didn't need it for news, since news was broadcast over the air for free. No one was going to cry because their neighbors had to start paying $200/month for ESPN. They'd just say ""Listen to the game on the radio.""

That's not true of the Internet. Classrooms require students to use the Internet at home. Employers require employees to use the Internet at home. Government services are provided via the Internet. Sure the Internet enables some vice, but that's not exclusively what it's for, and most people understand that.

Like I said, once people see they're being gouged for access to what is a day-to-day essential service, they'll voice their displeasure at the ballot box. The only voters who might support this kind of gouging by ISPs (or be indifferent to it because ""Those kids and their Twitter!"") are old dinosaurs who are mercifully beginning to die off.

I am 1/4 devs on a small team at a company with about 40 total devs (spread across a few teams).

My team works on interesting stuff, and as a junior-ish I have a lot of opportunity to learn. Both my team lead and actual manager are amazing to work with, super reasonable, and very supportive.

However, I worry I'm starting to burn out because of one or two of my coworkers. My team lead is amazing, but for the most part ""four person projects"" are done by us. One dev is just... meh. The other (""Kevin"", 12 yoe) is pretty bad at his job and incredibly hard to work with.

Stuff Kevin does:

* Implements features incorrectly because he doesn't read ticket titles/descriptions/comments, design specs, or Figma mocks (and jokes about it in private channels/team calls)
* Spins these failed tickets as ""things to iterate on"" instead of ""tickets missing baseline acceptance criteria""
* Leaves a lot of cleanup to me and my team lead
* Continually overshares + drags team group work off topic, including by bringing really personal issues and stuff that uncomfortably tokenizes me and my team lead (we're both queer women, but he is also bi)
* Just doesn't work for hours/days at a time
* Every few months he'll post something very inappropriate for work in a public socializing channel
* Nitpicks my PRs to no end, but similar or identical ""issues"" go unmentioned on anyone else's PRs
   * I am green, but I know that some of his suggestions on my PRs are just dirty code/bad practices

Fwiw, I think my manager is a bit suspicious of Kevin based on team feedback he's given me in my 1:1s.

Part of me wants to have a dedicated conversation with my manager about Kevin, but I'm scared it'll come across the wrong way. Kevin does something that frustrates me (at least) almost every day. It has a measurable impact on my work + the overall trust in our team, but at the same time evidence seems hard to get because he's so good at ""selling"" things.

The best I've done so far is make some small comments. Kevin has tried to throw me under the bus a few times but in very obviously-wrong ways (like... ""documented clearly in tickets + comments"" level stuff), which I've talked to my manager about. He was ""neutral"" but encouraged me to clarify things repeatedly in standup until the issue was resolved, and Kevin hasn't tried anything similar since the last time he did this in March.

I've had to deal with a LOT of sexism. 

The truth is that some men will just NOT see women as equals or fully capable peers. When **you** aren't fully a person in someone else's eyes, it's nearly impossible for **you** to get through to them. What I would recommend is finding someone who men do respect (which means another *man*) to call the men out on their sexism. Someone who is an ally to you and doesn't have the same baseline bias against women. 

It sounds like you already have a guy like that, your friend who reviewed your code and then got credit for it. I'd recommend telling that guy what these other guys have been doing and saying toward you, and ask if he could please call them out on their bullshit when someone says something. 

The guys bullying you - and they ARE bullying you - are cowards as all bullies are. Being confronted by a male peer who they respect will embarrass them and hopefully open their eyes to their prejudicial behavior.

Other things that you could do could be to not entertain their bad faith arguments. If they say ""this is unintelligible"" ask them what THEY do not understand. Make it about THEIR failings, rather than internalizing that it's something that YOU did wrong...but honestly, I'm trying to take my own advice here and it is HARD. I'm a logical person, and it's hard for me to recognize someone giving an emotional, illogical bad faith argument. 

They'll accuse us of being illogical, emotional women, but it's projection - they are banding together against ""the other"" (the person who is least like ""them"") due to their personal massive insecurity about their own competence. Instead of reflecting on why they feel insecure, they take it out on the ""girl"" encroaching ""on THEIR turf."" It's so stupid. But that's why someone who IS ""like them"" is going to get through to them when you can't.

I wish I could headbutt these guys straight into the sun for you. Don't worry about being a bitch, because really, their behavior is stereotypical mean girl behavior. For me, my self-respect is really important. I *never* want to feel like a doormat that people walk all over without any caution. If standing up for myself makes me a bitch, I can respect myself if I'm a bitch - bitches have teeth they can and will use, after all.

I really don't think there will be enough outcry, or that they won't listen. I generally have the sort of think that our leaders don't listen to us any longer... And that we've been sold out to lobbyist interests that are what make the scenario in the above post possible.

But let's ignore that and think of a scenario of what happens when the above steps are taken into action.

Scenario A: We start to receive broad band throttling, and the major websites slow down. They cave (like they have in the past, when netflix paid verizon), because lets face it, they have enough money to pay the ISPs (Netflix, facebook, youtube) because otherwise every second without service is a second without money being made. And the ISPs can lie and blame those companies for having server issues. So what happens if they don't pay? ISPs offer an appealing enough package for Americans go to the convenient ISP video sites. Until eventually the major companies pay (I think they already thought of this scenario, so they will just immediately pay). Eventually, a majority of America keeps using what they use 90% of the time so all looks good under the surface! The other websites, they slow down enough to the point that we still use them fine, and we use netflix/facebook/youtube w/out bandwidth issues so maybe we never see the bandwidth issues on those sites at all! After all, we're a bunch of zombies and americans do watch the most TV/consume mindless media for a majority of their time. So looking at the average numbers, we don't have any immediate complaints from most people. Where it hits the most, are the smaller companies that can't afford to pay. Eventually, their websites just get swallowed by the bigger conglamorates who can afford to pay more to have their website more accessible. Welcome to the death of small companies in America where only the big companies can make successful startups! This is probably when you and I leave the nation.

Scenario B: We start to receive throttling, similar problems as the above. no one listens. But we resort to a black market economy and criminalize the internet as we once knew it. A majority of the non-average Americans who really need that unlimited internet access, use smart computer tools which obfuscate data and make it look to the ISP as though its passing to sites like youtube/facebook/etc but actually go to other sites. I'm not a networking expert, but I figure we need this type of sophisticated tooling. It because a game of cat and mouse where we make tools to get around ISP blocking, and they make tools to block the newest tool. Criminal economy. Eventually, this may become a big enough hastle that you have to leave too.

Either that or you don't know the specifics around their plan wel enough to list them accurately.

Without any insider knowledge I can tell you that this is a general concept of their plan.  However, I would say that your steps are off.  I don't have any numbering system, but their plan is more along the following lines:

Repeal NN, but more importantly Title II.  This is their major goal and milestone.  Without Title II it is pretty much known to the ISPs that they can do what they want per the Supreme Court ruling that led to reclassification to Title II.  Title I has effectively little-to-no authority granted to the FCC over broadband.

Their next step is to either move forward as-is, or more importantly, have their Congress critters (Repubelicans) propose NN protections through a bill.  This bill will actually do the opposite of what they say, as do all Repubelican bills, and would actually keep throttling, blocking, etc legal while also revoking all meaningful authority the FCC has over ISPs.  THAT is what this NN repeal is truly about.

Moving forward they will do as other countries without NN have done, like Portugal, where they have internet tiers.  They will also spread data cap practices.  They are likely not going to ever lower the caps, but instead the ones already in place in many cities, typically 200-300GB, will simply not be raised in a timely manner to match the expanding use of the internet and data needs.  Thus, the cap lowers itself naturally.

The redefinng of broadband to include wireless is simply so that this corrupt FCC can claim that all Muricans are covered by ""broadband"" and it allows the telecoms to sit on their thumbs instead of actually serving rural Murica.

I'm not sure I get what you're talking about with utility pole access since that is already locked down, and in many cases owned by incumbent telecoms, hence why Google stopped their Fiber rollout.

The end goal is effectively the same as yours except for the singular data cap you mention, though that may come into play for people who have one company for both wireless and home service as well.  I've been watching this unfold for years and this is literally the reason I switched from Republican to Democrat / liberal.  I monitored the net neutrality topic before it gained any traction and decided that whatever political party made this basic and simple consumer protection and regulation a partisan issue and went against NN would clearly be corrupt, end of story.

Preface: I would like to hear mostly from coders/programmers who have children, please let me know your experiences.

Hey yall, I know this is an odd situation (maybe not for you) but ppl in the pregnancy/ttc spaces wouldn't quite get it.



Im learning code full time right now though Harvard CS50, I just finished FreeCodeCamp's Javascript guide. Im hoping to begin applying to internships/jobs Summer '23 if not Spring depending on how confident I am.

My husband (24) and I (27) have both our cars paid off and are living with my parents to save money (we have a generous emergency fund) they also expressed support with us having a baby here before we buy our house (hopefully Fall '23 or Winter if I can secure a job). We have a good fund stacked so I can self learn until I get an internship.


So now it gets to the baby phase. My initial (personal) deadline for having a baby was 25-26ish. So I'm kinda sweating here. But I don't know if I should take on the pregnancy NOW while learning, although I can imagine myself super stressed by the timeline of getting an internship (possibly 4 months ish preggo) before they're born so I'm not extra stressed with a newborn. I also don't want to be overwhelmed with being a mom that I push the internship back.

But I also feel weird waiting until I get an internship/job, because then I'm dealing with the stress of acclimating to a new career, wanting to build up momentum, and then stopping due to maternity leave. In the other scenario, I would be more confident with being a mom and my children will be older rather than having a newborn at my new job simultaneously (which im super nervous about balancing).

I've already extended my timeline enough to include learning. I really don't want to extend it anymore. I can imagine myself resentful learning my love for coding so late in my plans.

(Not looking for feedback on if Im ready to be a mom or because we don't have a house we aren't ready, we pay for all our own bills/items except housing, and I've had 10 years experience with kids in many capacities).


I would like to hear mostly from coders/programmers who have children, please let me know you experiences.



UPDATE

thanks for everyone's feedback. After talking to my husband, he's almost 100% set on only 2 kids. With how the economy and world is going, this is probably the wisest decision. If my heart isn't doing well, we'll have a third.

(All advice welcome, but would especially like to hear from any gender non-conforming folks of color out there!☺️ )",cmjwuf,,"I really didn't think this kind of thing was going to be an issue for me. My first time around in college (for a history degree, at a very white, very rich private school), I never once felt out of place in a classroom. I live in a city that prides itself on its progressiveness, so I figured things would be fine. I was prepared to be the only black GNC in my classes, and for it to be a little awkward once in a while. And I figured there'd probably be some BS once I ventured out into the workforce. But I did *not* expect professors to be this micro-aggressive.

During STEM orientation, we broke out into small groups based on our majors. There were about 15 of us in the CS group, and I was the lone African American. The prof spent the first few minutes of his lecture staring me down. It was very uncomfortable, and I seriously considered getting up and leaving. I don't think there was malicious intent behind it. Looking back, I'm guessing he thought I'd wandered into the wrong breakout session, and he intended to help me once I realized my mistake. Intentions aside, I walked in feeling excited, and I walked out a little shaken and pretty disappointed.

But I put it out of my mind.

Then I took a math class over the summer. For the first month, any time I answered a question in class, no matter how right I was, the first word out of the professor's mouth was 'No.' Meanwhile, other more 'traditional' looking students were given the benefit of the doubt, even when they weren't word perfect in their answers. There was even one classic instance where I gave an answer, another student repeated it, and he was praised for it. There were only six people in this class, so it was pretty blatant.

Don't get me wrong; the prof was a nice guy. His subconscious bias didn't affect my grade (I killed it), and he ultimately adjusted to the fact that I am hardworking and capable- about two weeks before the final. 🙄

I like CS, and I'm confident that this is what I want to do for a living. But I'm starting to worry that I'm going to have to convince every individual math and science professor that I belong here. I know a lot of the people who don't face this stuff don't see it as a big deal (if they acknowledge it exists at all), but it's fucking exhausting being viewed with suspicion by professors, and having to constantly prove myself just to be treated like a serious student. And knowing that my performance will either reinforce their biases or begin to clear the path for those who come after me is a lot of extra pressure.

If this is something you deal with/have dealt with:

Is this just how it's going to be? Does it get better/worse? How do you deal with it in the moment? How do you foster mentorships/recommendations in this environment?

TLDR: Questionable Manager Performance,y3s45p,,"I posted this in the thread Thickheaded Thursday in the SysAdmin subreddit, and then realized that the demographics there likely couldn't assist me lol.

All I did was ask if my team would have a set time to provide feedback on decisions he and others would be making at a meeting we (arguable the subject matter experts for the products our team manages) were purposefully excluded from. I'm at the last straw for my poor back and starting to think about job hunting. 

 Then in response to someone telling me that I should just start looking for other jobs if I hate mine so much, but I really don't. There's also not another team for me to transfer to, so here are some examples I gave of recent behaviors:

>Honestly the root of all evil at this point *is* unfortunately my manager, but it's all so subtle I feel like a crazy person for even going to HR about it. Examples include:  
>  
>Asking me to generate reporting and make recommendations about how much hardware to purchase, then not allowing me to even listen in on meetings where that's discussed with purchasing and one other department lead.  
>  
>Allowing me to unofficially manage our team's intern, but not giving me any concrete expectations for growth that he wants to see for them or expectations at all.  
>  
>Inconsistently showing up to 1:1 and team meetings. We went nearly a month without a team meeting because he kept canceling with the promise that he'd reschedule it.  
>  
>Hardly ever steps up to assist or back me up to end users on hardware policies.  
>  
>I found the main verdict on my yearly performance review (yeah, *found* because I haven't had that meeting yet. It's nearly three months overdue) and I was given a mid-tier rating, even though I think I can honestly say I deserved higher. Especially given that I only got a 1% raise as a result of that.  
>  
>Unfortunately, he can't take feedback on himself. Even if he has asked for it, and I try to make it a compliment sandwich with sugar on top, handled with kid gloves. :/ But other than things that are impacted by my manager, I really love my job. My coworkers are cool, the health insurance is great, PTO policy is awesome, and I *know* there's so much room for me to grow here and I've been trying to take advantage of that space...

I really want to love logging into work again. I do love my actual role, and I love my team members. But something *has* to give.

It is apparently the most high pressure team to be on in the entire company. Honestly I love it, I love the pressure and the challenge. The brand has such a huge audience, and I really feel like this is my chance to influence a positive impact however small it may be, so I love this opportunity. I’ve also just realized I’m sort of a geek when it comes to consumer products and brands. I love walking through the ailses at grocery stores and looking at all the new products and guessing how they probably came to be, I just find it really fascinating. 

But the work drama is so draining. The misogyny, racism, sexism and probably more isms at this company is covered by a nice progressive appearing outfit. Basically alot of talk and no action kind of place. 

As a brown woman who was not born in America, I’ve had to work extra hard to get here. I’m the most qualified person at my position level. People with the same background as me have been promoted before me. It bothers me but I shake it off, I haven’t really been in a big rush to get promoted because I’ve been wondering if I’m on the right path careerwise and all. 

But the drama and discrimination I get from other women, is driving me crazy. 

There seems to be this mindset among older millenial & gen x women of: I suffered so you should too. 

This is a female dominated field in this company. It wasn’t always, because nothing ever was. Most of our team leads are women,  while senior leadership remains pretty much on the white men + 1 or 2 white women to show diversity format. The team leads are extremely competitive and foster competition among the underlings. Whenever anyone speaks up, they have their voice heard ‘with empathy’, but then nothing happens or changes. We pretend everything is great. 

I’ve made good friends here but during times of competition they’ve really shown some distrustful behaviors. It felt hurtful to me that this toxicity would penetrate my life outside of work as well. 

But I really love the work. And I’ve had jobs before that have been pretty dull and boring, and that made me miserable in another sense as well. I’m so scared to leave this and fall into an even worse situation. 

I’m someone who wants to find joy in the work. My worklife definitely affects my personal life. I feel like I’m in a really good place in my personal life and very happy with it, but the work drama is the only source of negativity in my life. Love my personal life, love my work, but not the ‘job’ I guess. 

But what if I make a change and it fucks up the good things I have going on in my personal life. What if I never find this passion for my work at another place?

I of course supported Net Neutrality, but deep down I kinda sadistically hoped that vote would pass. How many times have they tried shit like this? It must be up in the high teens. They were never going to stop pushing their agenda. Net Neutrality was gonna go sooner or later. I'm actually kinda glad it's happening now.

Why? Because it will actually force the imbecile citizens that either didn't understand or didn't care enough to actively defend NN. That NY housewife probably had no time to learn about or didn't understand the importance of NN before. When she starts having to pay extra for Youtube, the one thing that will get her baby to eat his damn dinner, she'll understand. When the president of the Young Republicans Club at NYU, fiercely loyal to the ideal of making America great again (without knowing what made it great in the first place), hears the news that Netflix can't afford to make Stranger Things Season 4 because they're hemorrhaging cash thanks to the thing he supported repealing, he'll understand. Most people didn't understand or care. Only when they feel the effects will it get through their thick heads.

And the shittier it gets, the more common folk will support initiatives to reverse the problem, or even better, offer an alternative. Plenty of forward-thinking municipalities have explored providing their own internet service, but most have been thwarted by lawsuits or coercion from the big industry players. But the chief concern of every politician is re-election. These shady practices won't fly under the radar anymore, and their constituents will demand their support. 

And if that's too uncertain or too long of a timeframe, you can always trust in Based Musk. SpaceX is on track to have the first thousand or so of their low-orbit internet satellites in space in 2019. Most people already know and respect him, and when they hear that there's a low latency gigabit alternative to the ISPs currently reaming them in the ass that, much like Tesla, is a bit pricier but high quality and devoid of any fuckery, it will virtually guarantee that the only way these ISPs could thwart Musk (lobbying/legislation) will be shot down by politicians newly terrified of their own furious constituencies. 

This is a problem that will affect every American, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic class, or political affiliation. Everyone has their own internet persona and practices and preferences, but ISP fuckery will affect all of them more or less equally.

As a woman who is actively child-free, I am beyond frustrated with how little information there is out there that relates to my health concerns.  I have been on birth control for 16+ years and recently stopped because my absolute rockstar of a husband got a vasectomy.  Since I was 16 I relied on birth control my hormonal balance, which was possibly a questionable path -- who knows, really.    At times I've gotten out of wack and I've endured extreme symptoms that I've been told are normal by doctors.  I've come to my own conclusions about what's best for my health, but based on my normal standards for scientific backing, these conclusions are based on experience and pseudoscience, at best.  And that drives me nuts!

I recently saw an IG health influencer that quoted my symptoms word for word and I got a false sense of hope that there was some information out there.  I followed the person and the next thing I know my feed is full of essential oils and saltwater tonics.  This was a low point for me.  I realized that plenty of women experience the symptoms, but the scientific understanding just isn't there.

Ok, on to the r/girlsgonewired part:

This outburst was triggered by this list: [10 Outstanding Companies For Women’s Health](https://medicalfuturist.com/10-outstanding-companies-for-womens-health/)

I'm currently open to new roles, but not actively seeking.  Every once in a while after a particularly rough day I get the itch and start looking for roles with companies where I would vibe with the mission a little more than I do at my current company.

So, I had the thought: I feel strongly about women's healthcare and how much need there is to spread useful, actionable, scientific information.  Maybe that's a sector I should investigate.  And this was the first article I came across.

It opens with ""Women’s health technology, known as Femtech, has been expanding in recent years beyond its initial focus on fertility and pregnancy. It now addresses a wide array of women’s health issues including sexual wellness, disease management, menopause, pelvic health, and mental health.""

Great!  That's exactly what I'm looking for -- an industry that views my body is relevant to medical science beyond my child-bearing capabilities.  Yes, please!

It goes on to list 9 companies that are focused on supporting women in fertility and healthcare related to lactation, pelvic floor training, breast pumping, baby heart-rate monitoring, etc.  And one company focused on menopause.

Ask me anything!",ipt1sbi,,"I can think of lots of ways of making networks simpler and better.  But a good analogy is Englih.  It's a horrible language.  Spelling, pronunciation, ...it's all messed up.  But English pretty much can do the job.  And if it can't, people invent new words.  

Likewise with networks.  People invent ways of incrementally improving things, like with NATs, or CDNs, or network proxies.  So as long as there isn't anything that absolutely can't be done, people aren't terribly motivated to start from a clean slate.

That said, one example of how I'd do things differently is that I'd like packet forwarding be as simple as possible.  Just have your forwarding table give you several possible next hops for that destination, and let the switch/router put it on the shortest queue.  Let layer 4, or higher layers, deal with getting packets out of order or missed packets.  Also, I'd get rid of all variants of L2 forwarding, and just use CLNP and IS-IS.  I'd also get rid of BGP and do another level of link state routing if you need more scalability.

That said...there are horrible issues with the higher layers.  For instance, I was taken in by a scam.  Security on the Internet \*in theory\* is wonderful.  Human types DNS name, website sends certificate.  Wonderful crypto and protocols ensue.  Secure connection results.  But in practice....I needed to renew my driver's license.  I knew it could be done online.  But I don't have DNS names of places I need to visit every 10 years memorized, so I did a web search for ""renew Washington state driver's license"".  I clicked on the top result.  Had I looked inside the URL, the DNS name seemed fine...something like [WA-licen](https://WA-licencing.org)sing.org.  The website was just what I expected, with tabs for ""get a new license"", ""replace lost license"" ""renew license"".  It asked me what I expected (name, address, license number, credit card number, and I thought...success...one chore completed.  I probably would have become suspicious when I never got a license, but the bank fraud department asked me about lots of charges this company was making on my credit card, and I realized the problem and told my bank, which denied the charges and gave me a new card.

But....I claim I did nothing wrong!  How was I, a human, actually supposed to know the DNS name?

A paragraph I wrote in our book ""Network Security"" (3rd edition just came out...sorry for plugging it) is ""Humans are incapable of securely storing high quality cryptographic keys, and they have unacceptable speed and accuracy when performing cryptographic operations.  They are also large, expensive to maintain, and difficult to manage.  It is astonishing that these devices continue to be manufactured and deployed, but they are sufficiently pervasive that we must design our systems around their limitations"".

That makes sense. He actually told me that the person who was in this test role (before it opened up) ended up moving into a regular SWE role at the company after a few years. He also said that the company is open to ""wandering"" or letting me dabble in other areas if I wish. I took that to mean that I have some freedom to do other kinds of work if I'd like to try it. It seems that they're pretty open to switching you out if you can prove that you're able to do the work you're trying to get. 

I have a question for you since you have skills in full-stack. Like I said, my background is in EE and I recently decided I'd like to get into SWE instead. I know I lack a lot of traditional SWE knowledge so I was considering doing a program which trains me in a bootcamp style for a few months, and then hires me out to a client for a couple of years. I have done a lot of reading on this and apparently there are other programs like this out there that most of the CS subs seem to hate (Revature, for example), but the one I found seems decent enough. You'd have to pay back a hefty fee if you break your contract with them (deliberately) before the 2 years, but I'm literally starting from the bottom without a whole lot of SWE knowledge, so I'm fine with sticking it out for a couple of years with them just to build my experience, even if the salary is considerably lower than for traditional SWEs. I was told there is a possibility of contract buyout after the one-year mark anyway, so there's a chance I won't have to live with a low salary for very long. The one valuable thing I can see with this route is that I will be learning full-stack technologies, and would actually be taking the time to understand and gain experience with them first.

My question is: What do you think would be a better opportunity for me to take? I can do SDET at this startup with a higher salary and a possibility of a job title change somewhere down the line (although that's not guaranteed, and I am not sure what other technologies I'd be picking up on this job outside of using Python frameworks/coding in Python). I like the values and mission of this startup so it lines up very well with me, the people seem super nice and chill, but startups are indeed risky and I am not sure what that spells for my future in SWE.

Or, I could accept a 2-year contract with this consulting company/bootcamp program at a much lower salary (about 30k less than what I'd get at the startup), properly learn full-stack tools in the first few months, then work for a big company for a couple of years (I got a pretty high score on their aptitude screening test which qualified me for their higher-end locations in NY). With the possibility of then taking that knowledge and experience into other SWE roles (meaning even higher salaries). 

Apologies for the long post, just figured I'd capture your insight on how I could proceed forward with my options.

Exactly, but it's more than that: They were hated for the *way* they opposed the Obama administration. Deferring the SCOTUS pick was one of the most obvious ones, but government shutdowns, refusing to appoint cabinet positions and judges, the ""Saudi 9/11 law"" fiasco, stating on day 1 that their goal was to oppose the president at every turn, etc. were all tricks that were used to dump shit on Obama. While the Dems did do some of these things in the past (like blocking the naming of Robert Bork to SCOTUS), it was nothing like what the GOP did.

>Even though they have complete power in all branches of government, they still think of themselves as the opposition so they just keep doing things to spite the Democrats.

They still think of Democrats as their enemy. Not just their enemy, actually -- *America's* enemy. It's not enough just to beat them -- the GOP needs to *destroy* them and everything they stand for because they have painted them as anti-American. Nobody in the DNC has said or done anything of that scale to antagonize or decimate the Republicans like the Republicans want to do to the DNC.

>It's sad that they're using their power to take revenge on the Democrats rather than having a conservative solution to the nation's problems.

This will be the Democrats' saving grace if they don't fuck it up. Instead of being ""Trump bad, Dems good"" they need to get better at saying *why* they're better than the GOP. They can even compare their plans to the Republicans' plans using neutral language because of how ghoulish some of these proposals are on paper. Most importantly, they need to talk up economic issues and downplay *but not change or sell their souls* on social issues. Tell Farmer Joe how you'll protect his farm from Trump's environmental rollbacks and how these protections will enable them to keep the business in the family for generations. That sorta thing. Obama was good at doing this, while Hillary sucked.

>The closeness between corporate America and the political establishment is also troubling. I'm not going to say that Democrats are innocent but it seems that Republicans are more likely to bend to corporate demands in return for campaign contributions and kickbacks.

The problem of money in politics isn't new, but a few key SCOTUS rulings (*Citizens United* and the ""money = speech"" case in particular) added fuel to the fire. Now, at least for the time being, you need money and corporate backing to make it. This is where the Dems will fail because they'll want a candidate untouched by Big Money and won't be willing to compromise and support someone who believes 95% of the same things they do. The GOP learned this a generation ago thanks to Reagan's Eleventh Commandment and look how much power they have now.

&#x200B;

I had a rough road through undergrad.  Consequently, I thought it would be a good to do a postgrad experience. I got a diversity supplement, and was really excited because it's exactly the kind of thing I want to do.

&#x200B;

To say it's been a nightmare is...an understatement.  There are a lot of dynamics at play that I've never really seen before in a lab.  My PI is a physician and a new PI, and I don't think knew how to set up a lab.  Her lab tech has a business degree and doesn't know basic things, like what dNTPs are.  The other lab members speak almost exclusively Chinese, so it can be hard to get any training.  I google and have done ok, but sometimes there are miscommunications and it comes back on me.  Postdoc compulsively lies and takes my stockroom card and reagents so he's spent a lot of my federal $$ on his project.  PI does not believe me.  I think because I also have a non-verbal learning disorder,, it is very easy for me to end up in situations that other people would know to get out of. I trust easily and end up being the fall guy a lot because it's hard for me to fathom that someone would be dishonest.  Additionally, I've been able to troubleshoot a lot, but the other members of the lab hide data from the PI and run experiments until they go well and only show her those. I thought that was dishonest and didn't get the memo, so now unfortunately she believes that it is only me that has the issues, and has started questioning my affinity for wet lab work.  We created a mentoring plan to address my CP in the lab, and it isn't followed at all.  And I really need very little accommodations, but do need some.  PI is unavailable, and unresponsive to conversation.  Requests to follow up on the mentoring plan were met with the assertion that the lab isn't set up to support students with disabilities, despite the fact that she took me on with that as the central focus of my supplement.  

&#x200B;

I don't know if there are any PIs you know of out there who are hiring even technicians in cardiovascular research that are good with disabilities?  I don't have a mentor, and don't know where else to turn.  I'm really freaked out, because I'm alone. I don't have a support system.  The world outside academia can be even more unforgiving toward people with disabilities.  I can't drive, either, and the city I live in is pretty dangerous.  Other jobs outside of my institution will require that I use public transit alone and night and my obvious disability makes me something of a target.  I am afraid that I will end up homeless.  I could really use some assistance. 

&#x200B;

I work super hard without complaint. 12-15 hours a day in the lab, 7 days a week. And I'm happy to do it...but I want to be successful and be able to get by in the world.

Hi everyone! I made this throwaway account to be more anonymous because I’ll be talking about my job. 

I just changed careers. I have a communications degree, and switched to tech recently. I was a part of a Network/Security+ bootcamp and am currently preparing for the Network+ exam. I was very lucky and got my first IT job recently as part of the IT help desk team. I was hired as a short term contract employee along with a fresh out of school comp sci student. However, he was hired as a regular short term employee with regular benefits. He was given a Lenovo thinkpad that can code well while I was given a Microsoft surface pro, basically an ipad in terms of technical abilities. 

On top of that, my manager and director revealed in our first team meeting that they want me to work on documentation for everything we do and be “the face” of the IT Helpdesk team and create a Sharepoint database of how to fix common tickets that we can provide to shorten repetitive tickets. They gave me tickets on making email distribution lists on Outlook, whereas they want him to re-image a laptop already with a long term project of coding a more efficient pc inventory spreadsheet. They emphasized that we should focus on our individual skill sets and think about what we can bring to the team when I expressed excitement in learning how to re-image laptops and do scripting as well. 

I felt like I wasn’t being taken seriously and that they just hired me as a temp to do their documentation instead of a reliable technician. And the comp sci coworker is a know-it-all and is inconsiderate. He’d block my view when we were being shown how to troubleshoot conference rooms and he’d have tried to troubleshoot every conference room if I didn’t speak up and say I wanted to do it, or offered to split up the rooms. Whereas I make sure he can see too and fill him in on a conversation I had with the manager while he went to the bathroom. 

I know I have to show better results than him, and I think talking about feelings is a no-go with a team of all men. I think I gotta be confident in my abilities and show willingness to do documentation but express that I want to move away from communication and do/learn more technical stuff as well. I also have to be less nice to the comp sci guy. 

Already I’ve shown that I ask better questions as someone who studied IT in my free time and because of my notes I knew how to troubleshoot a room when he didn’t remember. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that if I don’t get the recognition and room to grow in IT here, I am okay with going elsewhere. It’s just a little nerve wracking cuz the market is tough rn. But if I was able to talk my way into getting a IT Help Desk job with no certs or IT degrees or experience I think I can do it again WITH experience this time. 

The only issue is I’ll probably have to work with more men and I’m not sure the best way to work with them.

girlsgonewired,new,2023-10-24 20:03,2023-01-30 16:56,Instigated-,Comment,Moving down the ladder? Need mentor advice.,j6k2m0l,,"One of the things I like about software engineering is that it _isn’t_ a strict “corporate ladder”… people can be respected and rewarded for their skills without having to go into management, they can stay an individual contributor, with various levels of seniority, and managers don’t necessarily have more power or income than the engineers. 

You may not have seen that at the corporations you’ve worked at, however there are many other companies where that is the case.

There is some (niche) advise that managers shouldn’t stay in a management role for too long as their coding skills get rusty and out of touch: go back and forth every 2 yrs between management and IC roles to build strength at both.

There is a lot of acceptance in my circles for people moving from management to IC roles. In some cases (several people I know) it is simply that they tried management and decided they preferred coding.

Really, management and engineering are two different career paths that just have a little overlap, they are not stacked on a ladder.

What will other people think…?

I suspect that you are feeling a lot of shame from your last work situation, your mental health, and job gap, and are being hard on yourself, and projecting that self recrimination into imagining others will be equally judgmental. 

I say this as a career changer, I previously worked in a different industry in which most my LinkedIn contacts were from, and I then reskilled to be job hunting as a junior software engineer. I found it really psychologically difficult to update my resume and LinkedIn profile, I literally was I tears at times as it felt so challenging. I also had left my previous job because of terrible workplace, mental health, without lining up another job, and I had a huge 5 years gap (parenting responsibilities also played a part).

The first thing you need to do is give yourself some self care, be more forgiving of yourself, know these circumstances are not a sign of weakness or failure on your part. You’ve had a hard knock and it takes time to recover, and you may still have some healing to do.

When you update your LinkedIn, you tell the story you want to tell. You say you look forward to getting back to your love of coding, so your skills don’t get rusty, etc.

What will people think? Many won’t even notice your update. Maybe a few will think what you fear, however others will think you are making the right choice for you, some have taken the same step themselves, or know others who have, some will feel a bit jealous as they may be afraid to make the same choice even though they would prefer it because they are afraid of “what others will think”, etc.

In terms of this specific job, if everyone seems stressed that might be a red flag. Can you determine what they are stressed by? Is it just a bad week in the lead up to a release, or ongoing issues. Having worked in a some terrible workplaces, including one that I would say caused some trauma, workplace culture is the most important thing imho.

Some background on me: I started a degree in computer science in 2019 with zero experience in anything computers or coding. I was extremely intimidated by my peers who always seemed like they knew what they were talking about. Despite the fact that I would get good grades and occasionally the top exam grade, I still felt like this up to my senior year. This all changed when I did a senior capstone project (a year long group project where you make a website or piece of software). Working closely with the men in my group and doing a long project together made me realize how they just speak out of their ass. Long story short I realized that I was intimidated by nothing but a facade of confidence and intelligence.

I graduated in May and started a job as a software engineer. I joined a new project at this job last week and my project manager assigned me a mentor to help me get set up and going. He was helping me set up everything on my computer and asked if I had something on VSCode. I didn't really understand what he was asking. He told me ""oh my buddy is a genius at this stuff I'll have him do it for you."" 

The next day my mentor and his ""genius buddy"" of his come to my desk. He asks me to pull up VSCode and see if I can log on to the remote servers through it. I had set that up already, but it required me to type my password in. He said ""oh let me just do a quick fix to save you time so you don't have to type  your password everytime."" So I let him set at my computer and try to do that. Here's a summary of what he did:

- Opens and restarts VScode multiple times and makes me type my password again everytime he opens it.
Edits the SSH config file with random values to try and ""fix"" the login configuration
- Opens Cygwin (bash terminal thing on windows) and has me log in with SSH on there
- Tells me ""It looks like I'm just gonna have to redo this whole thing because yours isn't set up right. Is that ok?"" I say yes (mistake)
- Deletes all my SSH keys on my computer and github
- Decides I have a ""bad instance of cygwin"" on my computer
- Tries to delete Cygwin
- Calls our company IT hotline to make them to delete cygwin from my computer 
- Goes back to his desk five times to ""see how he did it on his computer"", comes back, tries something, it doesn't work
- Deletes and redownloads VSCode
- Becomes stumped and fixated by the existence of a ""known hosts"" file on my computer. Assumes it's the root of the issue
- Etc for 5 hours. I am not exaggerating. He gives up and says something like ""yeah sorry it seems like you just have something messed up with your computer"" and leaves

He walked away and I had to fix everything he fucked up. I then opened google to look up how to setup the SSH VSCode thing. I follow a guide and it's done in ten minutes. smh

Anyways yeah it just feels like another instance of me listening to a man because he sounded so confident but then realizing he doesn't know what he's saying.

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:34,2020-09-15 8:23,mcherm,Comment,Nervous about getting into tech,g5cjz3w,,"When two groups appear in a particular workforce at noticeably different rates there are a few reasons that could explain it. Perhaps there's an inherent difference in the interest or abilities of the two groups. Perhaps there is societal pressure constraining one group's opportunities or encouraging them differently.

I haven't seen any studies, but I suspect that people who are completely blind are under-represented in tech. Now, there ARE some blind programmers -- it's possible to do the job -- but there are a lot of inherent difficulties. Many of the tools we typically use aren't accessible to someone who is totally blind. Even the best screen readers don't allow skimming of text as quickly as sighted readers can do it. There might ALSO be a bit of prejudice: hiring managers may doubt whether a blind programmer can do the job even for the programmer who CAN. However just knowing that the percentage of completely blind programmers is lower than the percentage of completely blind people in the population isn't enough for me to be certain how much is discrimination and how much is due to other limitations. (The fact that many people lose their eyesight late in life, long after their career track is set and often after retirement may also figure in.)

On the other hand, if I found that folks who's names are in the last half of the alphabet represented half of all people but only 20% of all programmers, that WOULD tell me something. (It definitely isn't true, but let's run with the example.) While blindness *might* affect one's ability to use the tools we have really good reasons to think that the spelling of one's name doesn't. And the spelling of one's name doesn't affect one's interest in programming or one's ability to work with abstract concepts like pointers. It is far more likely that this is caused by HR's tendency to always work through the list of candidates in alphabetical order or something like that.

And this would be a problem, because we're probably hiring some acceptable people with names beginning with ""B"" and missing some *excellent* programmer's whose names begin with ""W"". Worse yet, this industry is often constrained by our ability to hire enough competent people: we could keep all the ""B"" people we have and just *add* the excellent ""W""s and it would be huge win. Therefore, we can be fairly sure that our company will do better if we force HR to stop alphabetizing names. We would also do well to encourage people with names late in the alphabet to apply -- they might not even be *considering* the job because of our history of discriminating.

Finally, I want to express my STRONG belief, based research as well as personal experience, that the categories of ""gender"" and ""people of color"" are more like alphabetical order (where it clearly has nothing to do with the actual skills) than they are like blindness (where it might have *some* relevance, especially given some of the tools we use today). I wouldn't want to hire someone unqualified just because they were a person of color or a woman, but I CERTAINLY would feel that we ought to encourage folks in those categories to consider the career. We need them!",3178,gendered split perception,,,two group appear particular workforce noticeably different rate reason could explain perhaps inherent difference interest ability two group perhaps societal pressure constrain one group opportunities encourage differently see study suspect people completely blind represent tech blind programmer possible job lot inherent difficulty many tool typically use accessible someone totally blind even best screen reader allow skim text quickly sight reader might also bite prejudice hire manager may doubt whether blind programmer job even programmer however know percentage completely blind programmer low percentage completely blind people population enough certain much discrimination much due limitation fact many people lose eyesight late life long career track set often retirement may also figure hand find folk name last half alphabet represent half people 20 programmer would tell something definitely true let run example blindness might affect one ability use tool really good reason think spell one name spell one name affect one interest program one ability work abstract concept like pointer far likely cause hr tendency always work list candidate alphabetical order something like would problem probably hire acceptable people names begin b miss excellent programmer whose name begin w bad yet industry often constrain ability hire enough competent people could keep b people add excellent w would huge win therefore fairly sure company good force hr stop alphabetizing name would also well encourage people names late alphabet apply might even consider job history discriminate finally want express strong belief base research well personal experience category gender people color like alphabetical order clearly nothing actual skill like blindness might relevance especially give tool use today want hire someone unqualified person color woman certainly would feel ought encourage folk category consider career need,0.58573082,Subjective
womenintech,new,2023-10-24 20:37,2023-03-27 9:54,android_queen,Comment,How to handle pushy coworker? Only woman on my team,jdvc6yh,,"(I'm coming at this from the perspective of someone fairly senior and in a different industry, so please take all of this with the awareness that my perspective may not have the necessary context.)

I'll start with the easy stuff -- the interrupting and aggressively steering conversations is not okay, but it is very very common, especially among people who I would call ""new seniors."" Most of the time, it's just a matter of being overly excited and wanting to get the words out there, but that doesn't make it okay. There are a lot of tactics for this: ""Excuse me, I wasn't quite finished,"" ""Can we go back to <previous topic> for a moment? There was something I wanted to address."" If he thanks you for your time, that's a good sign, in my experience, that he is likely not doing this out of explicit disrespect.

As for the balance of not getting steamrolled -- there's no amount of good advice that is too much to accept. You should make sure you *understand* *why* you're changing your code or approach, but if he suggests a better approach for literally every line of code, and literally every single suggestion is a good one -- take the suggestions! If you've been coding without input from anyone else for the last 5 months and this is your first coding job out of school, there's a pretty good chance that there are improvements to be made. There's no value in keeping things just because you're the one who thought of them, if there's a better idea. I call this ""leaving your ego at the door,"" and it can be especially challenging when you're not sure what feedback is valid, and what feedback is related to the fact that you're young and female.

Now, the thing is, your post raises a *lot* of questions for me. It's very unusual, in my experience, for someone fresh out of school to be made the lead for a project, even if the lead leaves. (In most cases, either your manager would take on lead responsibilities or you might be made interim lead, with it explicit that they were actively looking for someone to take the lead position.) This is not because juniors don't deserve awesome opportunities, but because most juniors, if put in the position of lead for a project, will not be set up for success. (For example, as a lead, I cringe when I see you say he tried to blame you for something that he was partially responsible for because, as lead, you *are* the responsible party. The buck stops with you.) So here are a few questions I have (some of which you may not be able to answer, but might be worth thinking about):

* Did your manager make it clear *to him* that you are the project owner? Have they reiterated this since hiring this new guy? Is it possible that they are considering having him take over as lead?
* Most senior devs do not aspire to work on a project that has a junior as a lead. Why was this job appealing to this guy? What did he think he would get out of it?
* How was/is your job performance? You say the transition was rough, but would you say that, overall, your manager thinks you're doing a good job?
* You say his role is to assist and troubleshoot/test code. What exactly does that mean? Do you assign him work? Does your manager?

I’m pretty much doing the work of a technical analyst with a system engineer job title. For context, the other intern I work with is a man and I feel like we are both different people. He is more outspoken and tries to go above and beyond. I on the other hand, am more open to learn and sit back/listen. I feel like I do better with getting the team to like me, vs him being better at the job itself. I’ve expressed wanting more opportunities to code (the most that’s available is powershell scripting) but they still handed those projects off to him while excluding me. My manager later met with me to let me know he wants me included in that project as well. 

My manager is a great, supportive man. I think he senses how I must feel because he has asked me to lead and not let the other intern step in. I know he knows the other intern probably does too much, but at the same time no one can blame him. He is trying his best to get hired and look good as he graduates a year earlier than I am. 

I just feel like shit. I feel like I’m not doing the work I’d like to be doing. I’ve tried to include myself in other projects but it’s so slow as they need to be approved by managers in different departments. So most days I am stuck solving tickets and self teaching myself code/scripting. I’m often thinking of ways I can stand out but at the same time, I don’t really like the work I do. I understand its importance and I only took the internship bc i was getting rejected everywhere else. It’s just not for me. I want to code and most days im not. I try to find opportunities to showcase my work or to just get myself out there, but I get discouraged when the other intern is given more opportunities by my colleagues. There are also hardly any women on the team to connect with. I just feel like they don’t know what I’m capable of. 

I also have ADHD and social anxiety, which I’m actively working through with medication and therapy. I know this plays a large part of my internship experience, but I work hard and I fake it. Meaning people would probably not assume I have social anxiety. I push through my fears to appear social but deep down I’m always feeling on edge and that everyone thinks I’m not as good as the other intern, despite it being a pretty chill + non stressful work environment. At the end of the day, I complete my work and everyone seems to be happy with what we do as interns.

girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:04,2023-09-09 9:13,SeveralSpiderPlants,Comment,"""Women in IT"" groups",jzt73c7,,"I tend to agree. Been a woman in tech for 25+ years now in companies from 80 to 30K employees, and in bigger companies there's definitely a reluctance to be friendly with women (in the same way a man would be friendly with another man) in case it's misconstrued or they accidentally say the wrong thing. If somebody accidentally makes a smutty pun (which I find hilarious myself and regularly make them with friends outside of work) there's this sudden awkwardness and I often feel obliged to reassure everyone in a light-hearted way that I'm not going to go running to HR (or I make a worse one myself which really confuses them!!). 

For a man, it's basically just going to be easier and more straightforward to be friends with another man in fear of accidentally saying the wrong thing - never mind if the actual woman in question doesn't actually care, they can't ever be certain of that. 

We all know that promotions at a more senior level are based on who you know and relationships, and less your performance or impact, especially when resources are tight. For the last decade I am sick and tired of hearing about how outstanding my performance is, how I'm due promotion, but there's a queue ahead of me waiting to be promoted. Every cycle this always turns out to be either those with a solid friendship with management, or ones who are able to make a lot of noise in meetings (green flag for promotion unless you're always wrong) because they have a network of friends who have their back so they appear more competent and are more confident. When I speak up, it's a lot harder to get that wider support, which not only makes me appear less competent but makes me less willing to speak up too. And that's even disregarding unconscious biases which heap on top - just the nature of having more workplace friends makes a huge difference to prospects on its own, never mind the unconscious sexism going on. 

On the plus side in recent years even if I appear to have fewer workplace friends, I also have fewer clearly quite creepy approaches too, but that could just be because I'm getting older now and feel more comfortable mentioning my husband and children :D 

Thankfully at most places I usually do have a few male friends who know better - usually these men are happily married and pretty much always have daughters, which says it all really. The few that aren't married who have been (non-creepy) friendly are always very sociable, chatty people generally and quite unusual in this line of work! Or the reverse is true - men who are oblivious to social expectations and haven't twigged I'm ""dangerous"".

In answer to the OP - never worked anywhere with a decent women's group, or when I have, I've been excluded. Current place driving me crazy as it's global with US HQ, they do loads of ""women"" things in North America and Asia, but I'm in EMEA and they ignore us. I've reached out to them three times privately but promises are made and nothing happens. So now I troll them regularly by commenting publicly on their stuff on internal boards saying how great it looks and when are they coming to EMEA and they always say ""oh, we will"" but it's been four years now..!

Most things were still done by men at the end of the day. Most cities were rebuilt by the Allies, POWs and construction companies. Women are nowadays portrayed like they did everything, another point where feminism aligns with Nazism (the both hail them for propaganda purposes). A feminist calling a Jew a Nazi is another one.

> Many countries have a ministry for equality, not a ministry for women.

Just a word, just like your ""Gleichstellungsbeauftragter"" that can only be a woman and elected by women. It is still only about women, but a better disguise for the obvious.

>  I like this a lot more. We have some men shelter for male rape victims here in germany, thats a good start.

Domestic violence shelters for men have to cope with the extreme hatred and blockade from almost all feminists and leftists. They get zero public money because ""only women are victims"". Erin Prizzey proved them wrong and got threats of murder by feminists until she fled the country. They know they are so wrong on so many levels that they have to resort to that and get away with it because the governments love feminists (for their crookedness).

And most feminists consider ""male rape"" a joke at best, especially if it is perpetrated by women.

> Oh that must be schrödingers women, they shouldn't work but should pay more taxes?

They should work, nobody talks about housewife's here. But they should do it with the same obligations and duties men have. No preferential treatment, no extra rights and privileges men will never get.

> What do you say to the fact that women get way less pension than men just because housework is not payed?

Men do a lot of housework too, it is just totally unvalued by feminists and crooked politicians. Carrying heavy stuff, doing technical stuff at home and so on next to a 40+ hours job. Women work part time or not at all because their male partner works probably more than full time and then men should do all the housework too? If you change the law that gives women a free pass on alimony and full control over children towards equality for men then they can work 70+ hours a week too and men can do childcare. But then childcare will suddenly be considered ""just sitting at home"" because if men do it no value is placed into something at all. If women do it it is considered hard work far worse than steel and construction work (almost exclusively done by men).  Also, if men would do all the childcare then there would be maximum punishments for neglecting children or raising them to be thugs. If women fail to raise children properly, nothing happens to the mother.

> What do you say about the things that women do for men? Like giving birth under pain, breastfeeding or listening to our pitty compains about how hard the world is for us poor poor men ;) 

Their problems are absolutely nothing compared to men who get sent to war like cattle (contemporary example: Syrian war causalities: >95% men), face all serious and deadly injuries at work, get bad health treatment (all money is poured into female health nowadays) , lower grades in school for better performances (which results in a lot of male dropouts), have a more than 5 years shorter lifespan an so on.",3334,gendered split perception,,,say tought situation lot woman show much woman let thing still do men end day city rebuild ally pows construction company woman nowadays portray like everything another point feminism align nazism hail propaganda purpose feminist call jew nazi another one many country ministry equality ministry woman word like gleichstellungsbeauftragter woman elect woman still woman good disguise obvious like lot men shelter male rape victim germany thats good start domestic violence shelter men cope extreme hatred blockade almost feminists leftist get zero public money woman victim erin prizzey prove wrong get threat murder feminist flee country know wrong many level resort get away government love feminist crookedness feminist consider male rape joke best especially perpetrated woman oh must schr dingers woman work pay tax work nobody talk housewife obligation duty men preferential treatment extra right privilege men never get say fact woman get way less pension men housework pay men lot housework totally unvalued feminist crook politician carry heavy stuff technical stuff home next 40 hour job woman work part time male partner work probably full time men housework change law give woman free pas alimony full control child towards equality men work 70 hour week men childcare childcare suddenly consider sit home men value place something woman consider hard work far bad steel construction work almost exclusively do men also men would childcare would maximum punishment neglect child raise thugs woman fail raise child properly nothing happen mother say thing woman men like give birth pain breastfeed listen pitty compains hard world us poor poor men problem absolutely nothing compare men get sent war like cattle contemporary example syrian war causality 95 men face serious deadly injury work get bad health treatment money pour female health nowadays low grade school good performance result lot male dropout 5 year short lifespan,0.447759104,Objective
girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:11,2023-05-06 20:10,Instigated-,Comment,I’m having a hard time figuring out what direction to move in and I’m feeling pretty lost.,jj5gdic,,"When I reskilled, I started with a clear understanding of my motivations. Why I was making the change, what I needed in my next career (what had to be different), what was essential versus not essential in my desires. This helped me evaluate my options and keep on my chosen path even when it got hard.

There are a few assumptions in your thinking and perhaps a bit more research on the different options would be helpful.

Web development is a big broad field. 

If you like making simple static websites but don’t want to learn JavaScript there are lots of small businesses that hire freelancers or web development service companies to build their simple static website. Often a low code web builder tool or cms like wordpress, wix, shopify etc is used. 

In a smaller company, like one doing a lot of simple websites for clients, they often want people who wear several hats rather than specialists - and in such a company they may want a whole jumble of skills to a shallow degree, and this is where the line can blur and people may say to learn a bit of everything - development, design, seo, sales etc. This can also be true of working in-house at a non-tech company building and maintaining their website.

Similarly, if you freelance then you act as a one-person-band and may have to fulfil all these roles yourself.

However, the industry is bigger than simple static websites. 

If you want to work as part of a team on more complex websites/products, then you can specialise (don’t need to learn a bit of everything).

While UX/UI design are often bunched together, they are actually two different things, and I wouldn’t call either of them a sales role.

UX design is about understanding what users want and need, combining this with the business’s needs, and designing the website (or product) with this in mind to give the user a good experience. It might involve focus groups or customer interviews or other research to gain these insights.

UI design is about designing the aesthetic of the website/product - what it looks like, how it embodies the brand, etc. 

A frontend role would most likely require you to know JavaScript and how to work with an API etc. It’s not unusual for people to struggle to learn how to program - on my path to reskilling into software engineering I taught at a bootcamp and  so many students struggled when we got to JavaScript and questioned whether they were cut out for this role, but they persevered, kept trying, learnt it, and are now working in the industry.

If your motive is to get a better job than retail, there are also a lot of other roles in the tech industry that might be worth exploring. Testing, quality assurance, systems engineers, data scientists, IT support etc… these roles don’t necessarily need coding skills or much in the way of coding… as well as non-tech roles like recruiters and people and culture…

While I know you are trying to narrow your options to make a decision rather than have me throw more options at you: this is where having a clear understanding of your motivation and requirements helps. 

My new career didn’t have to be what I most “liked”, it had to meet other practical criteria - where were the career opportunities, and what was different from the things that tripped me up in the last career. Your criteria may be different to mine.

If you think this is fun, wait until you discover that not only will they question everything you say and do, they won't support you at promotion time.  They'll promote their guy friends over you.  Eventually when they've taken care of their pals they'll throw you a crumb.  Oh, and they'll come up with a million useless excuses, essentially blaming you. It's not that hard to make a mountain out of a molehill if it's necessary to get their way.  They'll also tell each other about all the cool new opportunities and essentially shut you out.  You won't find out until too late, which will of course slow your career development.

For me, the way around it was to change jobs/companies every 4-5 years.  The time I spent 9 years at one place was 4 years too many, and I missed out. I got terrific reviews but magically ALL of my coworkers, ALL of whom were male, were promoted ahead of me.  Apparently hard work and great reviews weren't enough.  I wasn't in the 'club', so I didn't catch a fair shake.

If you can keep your skills current you'll find you'll be treated most fairly (if that's even possible) when you're negotiating for a new job.  Don't believe them when they lowball and say you'll get promotions and raises later.  It's a crap shoot.  Quite often it won't work out.  GTFO when you see that they're not treating you fairly, e.g. the guys are consistently getting promoted over not just you, but the other women as well.

I've found that the work is the easiest part.  Just being treated fairly was always the hardest part.  Not all guys are this way, but enough of them are that the 'good' ones really don't make much of a difference.

I know I sound bitter but I'm not the only one I've seen treated this way.  I watched a female PhD who was absolutely brilliant catch the runaround and get treated like shit for years and years.  After she made Principal Engineer (finally; she'd earned that 5 years earlier) she decided that she didn't want to stay there and moved on.  She was utterly demoralized by the way she was treated, and she was easily as competent or more so than her peers.  When I see shit like this I think, ""Well, if they're screwing with her, what chance do I have?"" so I left too.

My consolation:  Instead of spending my lower salary, I saved and saved.  I maxed out 401k every year.  I put money into the stock portfolio.  As a result, I'm pretty close to being able to fund my retirement, and I'm way ahead of schedule with respect to retirement. When the next shitstorm arrives, they'll be scrambling paycheck to paycheck to maintain their expensive houses, spendthrift family, car loans, etc. and I'll be trying to decide what restaurant I want to eat at any given night. The cat will stay spoiled, and maybe I'll get a part time job to keep from being bored, or do some open source work, but I won't be forced to do anything if I don't want to.

So I'd say do yourself a favor and take care of your future financially.  We don't get a fair shake.  It sucks and it makes me angry, but there's not much I can do about it.  I can control my spending though, and I can keep my skills current so when the disparity gets ugly I can take some corrective action.

xxstem,hot,2023-10-24 23:49,2022-10-04 11:39,anti-pSTAT3,Comment,Strategies to deal with Men in Teamwork.,ir10xmn,,"To be upfront, I’m a man. But I do know a bit about some strategies for dealing with this, and I have dealt with similar bullshit, though probably less regularly. As you say, the thing here is not gender (of course), but insecurity. In your case that comes from sexism, but there’s plenty of insecurity out there to drive this behavior - trauma-based insecurities, and those rooted in racism, homophobia, transphobia, et cetera. 

What works for me:

1.	Find an ally and confide in them. Tell them what’s going on and ask for their help. 
2.	Tell your ally the best way to help is to ‘echo’. If you have an idea that you propose, they should, immediately after you speak, say “I really like Alexandria_CA01’s idea to do X.”
3.	Reciprocate wrt #2.
4.	When a credit is stolen, use your ally to take it back. They might say “I’m really glad you like the idea Alexandria_CS01 proposed, Chad; I do too.”
5.	Reciprocate. 
6.	Attribute ideas to your insecure male colleagues fairly (I.e., if it’s genuinely theirs). 
7.	if you get pushback, the fragile egos can be a tool for you to use. An ally who has become concerned about pushback might say “It seems to me it takes some real insight to see the brilliance/nuance in Alexandria_CS01’s idea. Thank you for helping to highlight that for us all, Chad.”

Your ally need only be interested in fair attribution. Their identity does not matter for this to work. 

If you can’t find and use a good ally, you have a harder road. You’ll have to do the attribution work yourself. For that, you want to inoculate, attribute, and get into feelings. 

Inoculate: At the beginning of a project, note that “WhIlE iM nOt CoNcErNeD aBoUt AnYoNe HeRe, I’ve noticed lately a culture of people taking credit for other peoples ideas and I could really use your help.” Note that it happens to everyone (even though that is false). “Can we try to build one another up and explicitly attribute ideas to the person who says them first?” Make them ‘white knights’ and praise the shit out of them *only* for appropriate attribution. If they take ideas from each other, call that out immediately. Your goal here is to get them to see it, and if possible, to believe it happens to them too. You also want them to believe it flies under the radar and, if possible, that “we are all guilty of this sometimes, and it’s not intentional, but still needs to stop.”

Attribute: as above, attribute correctly. 

Feelings: when you have to confront directly, use ‘I feel’ statements. “I feel undervalued when you claim credit for my ideas.” But also, lessen the blow in all but the most egregious cases e.g., “I don’t think that was intentional, and I think you just want what’s best for our work, but it still needs to stop. If it happened to you I would 100% have your back, and I need you to have mine now.”

Lastly, we need to manipulate their feelings some more. It’s worth noting often and loudly that the surest sign of a good leader (or of someone worthy of promotion, et cetera) is their ability to recognize and promote talent in others. Thank them when they do right by you and note that their positive behaviors make you think highly of them. 

In the absence of an ally, you have to create them, often from shitty people like Chad. But Chad is an insecure little boy who needs praise and you can use that to build a better workplace.

Feel free to add more suggestions.

Most of this list can apply to those who are still employed as well as those laid off. I would say, if you’re still employed, be grateful for your income but don’t let your guard down. Prepare for the worst, hope for the best! 

**Financially:**

1. Beef up your emergency fund - stock up on cash. Up to a year in basic mandatory living expenses saved is great, just in case.
2. Start a side hustle - diversifying income streams is a powerful way to combat a recession. Even if it's an extra $50-$100 a month to start, it can make a difference.
3. Focus on paying down high interest debt and not accruing more (credit cards especially)
4. Invest if you can - markets are down, buy low sell high - this is where wealth is made! Don't be scared of the bear market.
5. Do not panic with your investments - easier said than done, but super important (often times no action is the best action)
6. Make sure you understand your own risk tolerance and current asset allocation (while making changes may or may not be the right move, you still should be able to sleep at night). 
7. See if you can reduce monthly fixed expenses (housing, transportation costs especially - more effective than cutting out lattes and other small items)
8. Do a 30 day subscription challenge - cut out as many as possible for 30 days, after 30 days evaluate what you really miss and what you don’t
9. Track your spending using an app (easier than budgeting and gives you real time data)
10. Review your credit report and credit score - focus on improving it if needed

**Career:**

1. Learn a new skill and/or improve the ones you have, coursera and Harvard have some great free online classes
2. Clear the dust off your resume, just in case - make sure yours is designed well and highlights your accomplishments
3. Connect with your network and continue to build it - just because you haven't talked to someone in 10 years doesn't mean you can't reconnect!! Get out and make some new friends as well.
4. Update your LinkedIn - like a resume, it needs to be fresh and highlight the great things you've done. Make sure you have a good profile photo. All the relevant fields are filled out. I heard one CEO say if you don't have a professional linkedin photo and limited info in the initial screening for jobs, they'll move right on to the next candidate.
5. Look for new opportunities (again, just in case). Get a feel for what's out there in your industry and others.

**Personally:**

1. Remember recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle. Recessions are expected. We always recover. 
2. Prioritize your mental and physical health. Don't let the additional stress consume you. Nip it in the bud early.
3. Spend more time with loved ones. I'm going for a walk with a friend this afternoon and I can already feel the positive affect it's having on me!!
4. Focus on healthy things that calm your nerves. The early morning quiet, a late afternoon walk, closing my eyes for 10 minutes. These all work for me, do what works for you...consistently.
5. Don’t get sucked into the noisy news cycles and fear mongering. The media generally wants you to panic and become addicted to their alarming headlines. This will not help your finances or your mental health. Tune it out as best you can.
6. Remember the average recession lasts between 10-17 months.

If only that were remotely true. There were enough female thugs who started wars in the past and enough women who cheer to them. Nowadays it is even worse because a lot of women are now in power who can start wars (that only men fight and die in) but aren't accountable to anybody. Peace treaties were also written mostly by men. Nowadays women want to participate in all the parts that privilege them but leave all the dirty work over for men.

>  Sometimes the military is the saves group in war zones, especially in modern asynchronous wars. 

Doesn't matter, only men are conscripted. If they die society in general and women especially give a rats ass about them. If women die the feminists go crazy. They actually go crazy if women cannot attend their cosmetics saloon in a war zone. This is the kind of ""problem"" feminists care about. A billion men could die and they wouldn't even care except for their own petty ""problems"".

> You sound like you never talked to a feminist. The things you say are typically written in right wing articles against feminism, when you talk to feminists personally almost all of them would agree to most of your points.

Just because they ""agree"" (which they wouldn't if it somehow befitted men or meant obligations for women) means nothing. ""Judge them by their deeds not their words"", as the saying goes. None of them would ever act toward such a goal. Feminist politicians only want privileges for women, none of them ever said they would do anything positive for men. To the contrary, they would love to see mens lives getting destroyed if they could get even more privileges for women. Given that feminists wield absolute power nowadays they could change everything on a whim, but they love their privileges at the expense of men.

And ""right wing""? I despise Nazis and Feminists alike. Both would like to destroy me with their vile ideology. The SCUM manifesto wants to murder 3,5 billion men, the Nazis also tried to exterminate certain groups (NAZI women lived a great life in Nazi Germany, going to Lebensborn for leisure, snitching to the GESTAPO and writing countless love letters to Hitler while men were slaughtered), we know where that went. I like socialism without feminism, but this is not going to happen, so I am on nobody's side.

> It is okay for me, because we have a lot of privileges women will never get. In the end we are completely free for the whole span of our live while women don't get a promotion in their 20s cause they might get pragnent soon and don't get a promotion in their 30s and 40s because they haven been out of work for too long.

Laughable, because 1. women get countless jobs nowadays only because of their sex without any qualifications whatsoever (token women) 2. if they would work towards men getting the rights to participate in their children's upbringing then maybe they could work towards a promotion. Men have to pay for everything whereas women have the luxury to be at home while men pay for everything. It is pretty clear that men need promotions to pay for everything women have zero obligations whatsoever.

>  I can walk around with unshaved legs, they can't. I can meet with a lot of women and no one cares, when they do the same they are called whores. I can scream and people will listen, when they scream people will call it hysterical. I have a lot of privileges and I see no reason to complain about anything.

And it was all a con. As a former senior telecom analyst (and the telcos my clients) i realized that they had submitted fraudulent cost models, and fabricated the deployment plans. The first book, 1998, laid out some of the history ""The Unauthorized Bio"" with foreword by Dr. Bob Metcalfe (co-inventor of Ethernet networking).

No state has ever done a full audit of the monies collected in the name of broadband; no state ever went back and reduced rates or held the companies accountable. And no company ever 'outed' the other companies-- i.e., Verizon NJ never said that AT&T California didn't do the upgrades. --that's because they all did it, more or less. I do note that Verizon at least rolled out some fiber. AT&T pulled a bait and switch and deployed U-Verse over the aging copper wires (with a 'fiber node' within 1/2 mile from the location).

We should go after the financial manipulations (cross-subsidies) where instead of doing the upgrades to fiber, they took the money and spent it everywhere else, like buying AOL or Time Warner (or overseas investments), etc. We should hold them accountable before this new FCC erases all of the laws and obligations.

I am a young female who began working as a software engineer in 2018, right after graduation (I’m 24 now). Although I have liked working at the company I’m at for the past couple of years, there are a few things that happen/have happened that are starting to sour my feelings, so to speak:

* During a code review, while I was presenting my code, a bunch of the senior engineers jumped on me saying that how I did my code was wrong and did not match the requirements. I went to my desk right after and noticed that I was in fact...right. And I even knew that at the time, but I was too flustered to say anything in this meeting with 20+ plus people where I was essentially felt ganged up on (I get shy and nervous easily).

* I got one of the hardest assignments (change requests) on my team...something that a senior engineer should have realistically been doing rather than an entry level one. I came in on the weekends, worked late nights, ran back and forth between our labs to test my code, asked questions, did research, etc., to get it done and functioning properly. I learned a lot and had a great mentor through this, but I just feel like it didn’t do anything for me career-wise.

* While working on said assignment mentioned above, apparently a number of senior engineers said about me, “Wow I’m surprised she’s so smart!” Um...why would it surprise people that I’m smart? 

* There is another entry level engineer on our team who has also done a really difficult assignment like the one I was talking about (we lost a couple of senior engineers due to short-term leave these past few months making us short-staffed, which is why we had to do it). I notice that while this other engineer gets a bunch of praise and stuff for his work (even though there were a lot of errors), it just seems like management doesn’t care about the work *I* put in? Which leads me to my next point...

* During the integration process, it has happened TWICE where something would break, and no one knew why. Both times people pointed at my code, and both times...the issue wasn’t me. Like why blame me automatically if something goes wrong?

* During our performance reviews, I got an “average” rating whereas my coworker who I mentioned above got the next level up in terms of ratings. He was really surprised when I mentioned this (as was I when I found out) cuz we both feel like we have been “on par” in terms of effort and performance. We work super closely together too. My manager mentioned I was “almost” the next level up as well for my rating, but apparently because I’m “on my phone” too much, I didn’t get that rating. Which sounded really fishy to me.

* This last point is probably more of a “me” thing, but I just don’t feel appreciated or that my colleagues see me as competent. I notice that my suggestions aren’t taken as seriously, or that I’m not seen as “capable”. Idk if it’s a self-confidence thing or what, but yeah...

I’m not gonna lie...a couple of the points above have made me cry at times, which is probably me being overly dramatic, but I hate feeling so sensitive about these things. Am I overreacting to jumping to this feeling of, “I’m not respected” from the situations I described (aka am I overreacting??)? Could there be something that I’m doing wrong here?? I genuinely try my best, but idk how to make others see it that way.

girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:04,2023-08-25 7:12,CuteDiet,Post,"Cracking the coding interview. My tips, experience and what I would do differently.",160w7si,,"When I began preparing for coding interviews, I felt a mix of excitement and uncertainty. It took me around six months of dedicated effort to feel fully prepared. I spent the initial weeks revisiting core data structures and algorithms, ensuring I had a solid foundation. I vividly recall the moment when I realized that consistent practice was the key. However, if I am being completely honest, I am not sure if I would go the same way right now. I believe that what I missed the most was the person with the knowledge and experience to help me prepare faster and give me examples and experience with these things, because honestly it is sooooo tough and the competition is enormous. 

I thought I would share what helped me when I was preparing in case you are in the same situation as I was.

**This is what helped me the most:**

* **Know Data Structures & Algorithms:** Try to understand the fundamentals of data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees) and algorithms (sorting, searching). These forms are the core of coding interviews. 
* **Master Problem Solving:** Break down problems into smaller parts. Focus on the steps needed to reach a solution. This structured approach showcases your problem-solving skills.
* **Time Management:** During interviews, time is of the essence. Practice solving problems within time constraints to improve your speed without compromising accuracy.
* **Understand Trade-offs:** Be ready to discuss trade-offs in your solutions. Can you optimize for time or space complexity? Pros and cons show your depth of understanding.
* **Review Fundamentals:** Brush up on concepts like OOP principles, database basics, and web technologies, depending on the job you're interviewing for.
* **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to seek clarifications about the problem. It shows your analytical thinking and ensures you're on the right track.
* **Practice, Practice, Practice:**  Try to solve problems every day on platforms like LeetCode, and over time, the patterns become clearer, and your confidence grows.
* **Try to get someone to mock the interview**: Practice in front of the other person really makes a difference. Google some most common interview questions and ask your friend or family member to mock the interview at least a few times, so that you would be comfortable when the real interview comes to place. 

As I mentioned at the beginning, I am not too sure If I would go the same way right now and the reason for it is quite simple. I spent too many hours trying to figure out these things that would be simply explained and so many hours would be saved for coding practice rather than preparations for interviews. I came to this conclusion after talking with my colleague who has the same job as I and went to the bootcamp instead. The bootcamp he was attending had career preparations, mock interviews, helped them to prepare Github profiles and CVs as well as gave hiring insights to their students that I believe is a huge help especially in the current market where you have to stand out. I asked him what bootcamps have these kinds of things as I was skeptical about them before and he said that bootcamps such as Turing College, Springboard or Flatiron were quite good. Some of them even help you to get jobs after and that is a real plus I would say.

I hope that  this will be helpful for you if you are trying to get a job or thinking about learning coding in general. I know I am not the only one who had to go through this process, so please share your experiences as well. Maybe some of you went through these bootcamps and have insights as well?

ladydevs,hot,2023-10-24 20:52,2019-03-04 16:18,[deleted],Comment,"ELI5: How are our Phones so resistant to bugs, viruses, and crashing, when compared to a Computer?",ehsm1s5,,"I have to chime in here, because i think you have the wrong impression.

While modern smartphones get some aspects of security right, they get others horribly wrong.

&#x200B;

* The app stores

Phones are not per se more secure than any computer. They are computers themselves after all, running modified versions of desktop OS like Linux (Android) or iOS (derived from macOS)

Most of the additional security phones provide from a customer POV come from locking down what the user can do. By default, you can only install applications from your applicable app store. They are automatically and manually prescreened for malicious behavior and have very limited privileges.

So its all save, isn't it? WRONG!

A quick Google search turn up numerous incidents where Play Store/App Store apps were malware which sneaked through those screening processes, were installed on thousands of devices and stole user data, misused the phone for cryptomining or automatically show adverts.

Making the user believe that an app store app will probably not be malicious and making them not exert reasonable doubt is a big security flaw. It biases the user, who is already considered the weakest link in IT security, to expect security instead of insecurity. If in doubt, they might install the suspicious app anyway. This is dangerous.

&#x200B;

* OS software updates.

If a malware wants to do real damage and circumvent limitations imposed by the locked down environment, it needs to exploit security vulnerabilities in components of the OS. Those are software errors that can be used with malicious intent either to remotely gain access to the phone or circumvent the mentioned restrictions (a process is called ""privilege escalation"").

Those software errors are not rare but usually closed by regular updates of the OS.

Have a look at [https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards). As you can see, roughly 11% run Android versions <= 5.0 (leaving the 4.1-4.4 aside here).

Unfortunately, late updated versions of Android 5.1 were the first versions to fix the [Stagefright vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagefright_(bug)) discovered in 2015!

This vulnerability can be used to make a phone execute arbitrary commands through MMS or a video viewed in the web browser. There a still approx. 200.000.000 devices out there vulnerable to such an ancient security flaw. The same applies for hundreds over other vulnerabilities and while it was made considerably harder in new Android versions to exploit such vulnerabilities, there is still the problem that the phone vendors are not responsive enough when it comes to OS updates (because they want you to buy a new device instead)

&#x200B;

* Do you know if you are infected?

While there are antivirus applications in the app store, they still run with only slightly higher privileges (called ""Device Admin"") than any other app.

If you are seriously infected by malware that is not your average rouge app, the antivirus app will not find out. You cannot examine your phone at the system level, because you are locked out of it and not even a factory reset might help you if the malware escalated privilege to root and escaped the usual Android environment.

&#x200B;

My takeaway message is to not trust on your phone to be secure. To take care of your security is your own task. The weakest link in IT security is almost always the user, not the technology.

Adapt safe behaviors, ask yourself before installing an app if you trust the vendor and WHY you trust them. Also try to stay informed at least a little bit about the technology you are using.",3659,gendered split perception,,,chime think wrong impression modern smartphones get aspect security right get others horribly wrong x200b app store phone per se secure computer computer run modified version desktop os like linux android io derive macos additional security phone provide customer pov come lock user default install application applicable app store automatically manually prescreened malicious behavior limit privilege save wrong quick google search turn numerous incident play store app store apps malware sneak screening process instal thousand device steal user data misuse phone cryptomining automatically show advert make user believe app store app probably malicious make exert reasonable doubt big security flaw bias user already consider weak link security expect security instead insecurity doubt might install suspicious app anyway dangerous x200b o software update malware want real damage circumvent limitation impose locked environment need exploit security vulnerability component os software error use malicious intent either remotely gain access phone circumvent mention restriction process call privilege escalation software error rare usually close regular update os look https developer android com dashboard https developer android com dashboard see roughly 11 run android version 5 0 leave 4 1 4 4 aside unfortunately late updated version android 5 1 first version fix stagefright vulnerability http en wikipedia org wiki stagefright bug discovered 2015 vulnerability use make phone execute arbitrary command mms video view web browser still approx 200 000 000 device vulnerable ancient security flaw applies hundred vulnerability make considerably hard new android version exploit vulnerability still problem phone vendor responsive enough come os update want buy new device instead x200b know infect antivirus application app store still run slightly high privilege call device admin app seriously infect malware average rouge app antivirus app find examine phone system level lock even factory reset might help malware escalated privilege root escape usual android environment x200b takeaway message trust phone secure take care security task weak link security almost always user technology adapt safe behavior ask instal app trust vendor trust also try stay inform least little bit technology use,0.512954141,Subjective
girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:09,2023-07-06 17:28,ramy82,Comment,"Unseen, disrespected at work",jqxzai8,,"I'm going to take you at your word that you're not a good performer, and that what you're missing is feedback. 

I've been a leader in tech since 2017 (started as a project lead, became team lead, moved to manager, and am a director now). I've had to have hard conversations, including dealing with a very established team where half the people on it wanted a particular team member to be fired (spoiler: I didn't fire her and she's now a team lead on the same team). Giving someone negative feedback can be hard, and often it's easier to ignore problems -- make it easy for your manager to give you what you need by making it less ""I have to tell someone how they're failing even though they are already very insecure."" 

Here's what I would do if I were in your shoes:

1.) Update your resume, there's that no guarantee \*you\* are actually the problem or that you can single-handedly fix it. Planning for others to let you down is a valuable skill. ""You can do everything right and still fail, that is life."" 

2.)   Apply for jobs you're a good fit, write cover letters about how much you've learned, what skills you've developed, what cool things you've done. Toot your own horn.  Feel flattered when recruiters and talent acquisition fill up your voicemail. Tell them you're looking for a new challenge if they ask why you're leaving. If you find a better job, take it.  (Make sure the boss at the new job is someone you really gel well with - during interviews quiz them about their management styles and feedback philosophies). 

3.) Schedule a non-""1:1"" meeting with your manager. Make it a short meeting, don't set a specific agenda in the invite, put it down to a meeting about whatever project/team you're on if you have to specify anything.  (It's harder to simply reject a meeting if you're not sure what it's about).  Have it in person if possible. 

4.) Tell her about how much you enjoy whatever aspects of the job you like, talk very passionately about them. Then go for a ""but"" -- but you feel like you're missing something that's keeping you from bringing everything you can to the team/project. Ask her what she sees as additional things you can do or things you should do differently - that she can see things differently from her vantage point (trust me, things look different if you're an IC, a leader, or an executive). 

5.) Wait to see what she says, don't dwell on your insecurities. If she can't come up with anything let her know that if she can't think of something on the spot, tell her that you'd like to talk about it on your next 1:1. Start creating and putting agendas on them ahead of time if she keeps bailing - think of it as managing your manager.  

If she suggests something, even if you think it's BS (like creating reports on things you don't think matters, or taking notes) don't argue with it, and unless it's truly a hill worth dying on (unethical or illegal or something you would quit over), go with it at least for the short-term. Focus on building your reputation with her and her peers as being reliable and open to change - someone she can trust to enable what she sees as important. 

6.)  If she's vague, take the initiative to figure out what she means - ask her to confirm what you think she means. Focus on concrete actions with defined metrics, not on vague things (""be more technical"" isn't useful/actionable, ask her if she wants you to focus more on creating Proof of Concepts for adopting XYZ new technology or evaluating options for a new feature, or whatever). Keep it very positive and measurable solution oriented. You're basically asking for a good performance improvement plan without it being on HR's radar or official paperwork.

Modern operating systems make PCs a lot less vulnerable, but there are still plenty of ways to get burned.

### OS Design

Older PCs tended to let the computer have full control of the machine. So if a user could be talked into running a virus, that virus could do anything it wanted.

Newer PCs adopt a model that tries to limit what any one program can do to the system. In some cases, a program simply isn't allowed to do certain things unless the user has jumped through a lot of hoops. This was always true on *some* ""older"" operating systems like Unix, on which Linux, Mac OS, iOS, and Android are based. On Windows, this didn't start happening until Vista, and users immediately wanted ways to turn it off. 

On iOS, Apple is the only entity allowed to operate as a user with full control. You may root your phone to gain this power, but it voids your warranty. Android generally has this approach too, but some manufacturers make it easier to root your phone. If either of the phones are rooted, they are more vulnerable to a virus than they would be otherwise. This is related to the next part.

### Application Deployment

On old PCs, you didn't worry much about installing software. You put executable code on a disk and ran it. So all a virus had to do was talk a user into that.

In the Unix-style model, not every user is able to execute code if it isn't in certain places, and only special users can put executable code there. So a virus has to talk a user into talking someone else into installing it, which generally doesn't work. This is what Windows was doing with the UAC dialog everyone hated. ""Hey, something's trying to install software. Did you expect this?""

Regardless, if the person who *can* install software installs a virus, it passes the first hurdle and can start doing bad things.

App stores help combat this. On iOS, you can't install software at all unless it comes through the Apple App Store. That (presumably) means they have tested it to make sure it won't break your phone. There are some ways to install things without it (Facebook was exploiting one recently), but they are meant to help programmers debug thing and *still* require something called a ""digital certificate"" that tells you who to blame if it's a virus.

Android can be configured to only trust the Google Play store, but generally it's easier to install random programs on an Android phone. Thus, Android sees more malware and viruses than iOS because it's easier to trick a person who doesn't understand the implications into disabling their security blanket. 

Both OSX and Windows 10 also have app stores with similar status. Apple and Microsoft promise they've inspected the software within these stores to make sure it isn't malicious. The stores are also set up in such a way that if they make a mistake, they can block the software from running.

### Overall

So really the problem is perception. 

People were really used to Windows machines letting them have free reign, but that was really dangerous and made it easy for viruses to spread. When Microsoft started doing the right thing to combat it, people hated it and demanded that Microsoft let them go back to the dangerous way. And even when everything's on, it only takes one dumb ""Yes"" to install a virus.

iOS and Android released in a state that was more locked down. Since people didn't have a long history of ""wide open"" phones to compare them to, they didn't demand total access. Because the way you install programs is more locked down, and the impact any one program can have is significantly limited, these devices seem a lot safer.

But if you don't disable all the ""naggy"" features on Mac OS or Windows 10, and you only install software from their respective app stores, you get the same kind of safety.",3853,gendered split perception,,,o design software instal modern operate system make pcs lot less vulnerable still plenty way get burn os design old pc tend let computer full control machine user could talk run virus virus could anything want new pc adopt model try limit one program system case program simply allow certain thing unless user jump lot hoop always true old operate system like unix linux mac os io android base window start happen vista user immediately want way turn ios apple entity allow operate user full control may root phone gain power void warranty android generally approach manufacturer make easy root phone either phone root vulnerable virus would otherwise relate next part application deployment old pc worry much instal software put executable code disk run virus talk user unix style model every user able execute code certain place special user put executable code virus talk user talk someone else instal generally work window uac dialog everyone hat hey something try install software expect regardless person install software installs virus pass first hurdle start bad thing app store help combat io install software unless come apple app store presumably mean tested make sure break phone way install thing without facebook exploit one recently mean help programmer debug thing still require something call digital certificate tell blame virus android configure trust google play store generally easy install random program android phone thus android see malware virus io easy trick person understand implication disable security blanket osx windows 10 also app store similar status apple microsoft promise inspect software within store make sure malicious store also set way make mistake block software run overall really problem perception people really used window machine let free reign really dangerous make easy virus spread microsoft start right thing combat people hat demanded microsoft let go back dangerous way even everything take one dumb yes install virus io android release state lock since people long history wide open phone compare demand total access way install program lock impact one program significantly limit device seem lot safer disable naggy feature mac os window 10 install software respective app store get kind safety,0.508289322,Subjective

Is there anything you'd like to change about the way women are treated in STEM?,dtwpd40,,"Well I wrote this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/xxstem/comments/7vlga9/how_to_explain_short_stays_in_labs_resume_gap/

**What do you do?**

I was an experimental physicist. I worked in shared labs doing breaking-bad type stuff. I also worked in measurement labs. I shared spaces with men from all different groups to make devices and measure them. 

**What are your everyday experiences like?**

Awful. 

* stared at everyday like I wasn't wearing clothes

* men said creepy stuff to me a lot, e.g. one ""hip"" theorist sat next to me after eyeballing me for years and said ""I'm just sitting here to be close to you"". He looked right into my eyes, held the stare, then slowly looked away. He was nice to other women except me and this other woman, who he leered at so bad one time the man she was with was uncomfortable.

* men told me I was crap from ""oh a young woman like you shouldn't be doing X it's too heavy"" (I did weights, I was so ripped), telling men when they suck they're ""doing it like a girl"", when I asked for help I was told I was just asking because women always ask men and try to use their femaleness to get work done for free.

* some men didn't talk to me. That was one of my postdocs. Have you worked with someone who won't even talk to you, for nine months? It's hard. I had to suck up to him so much just to get instructions from him on how to do my job

* constantly interrupted, talked over, even one time spat on (this guy was screaming his amazing ideas at me while covering me with his spit - I physically stepped back about a meter).

* other men just look the other way as all of this was happening. Professors, senior researchers and all the high-ups. The worst is when you know everyone else is okay with what's happening to you.

**Or perhaps positive discrimination?**

Never. I can only wish.

**What (if anything) do you feel needs to happen to improve the lives of women working in STEM?**

Of the ten years I worked in academia, five men were invaluable to me, they:

*  supported me if they were powerless to change the situation. They said stuff like ""that's wrong"", ""I know, I was bullied by that guy too""

*  interrupted bad behaviour. It was really simple stuff like if a guy told a sexist joke they'd look right at him and say ""that's not funny"", or if I was being bullied they'd talk to the guy afterwards and say their behavior was out of line.

*  they provided physical protection. They'd go out with me, or walk me late at night if I was afraid.

* other tips include: just hire women. Have quotas. I know people want to get hired on merit, but if that were the case should't the hiring process for men be 20% get raped and 65% get sexually harassed to even up the playing field? If you don't want to do to men what's done to us, just treat us like men: give us a break because of our gender - men get heaps of breaks due to their gender.

* Another thing: make how men respond to sexual harassment part of their interview process. Questions could include ""how would you interrupt sexist jokes in the lab?"", ""what was your harassment / gender equality policy at your old lab?"" ""do you think gender equality is an issue STEM, if yes, what have you done to change the culture?""

* have traineeships for women, suck them in after undergrad and pay them cash for work. 

**What do you think can be done to enable more women to choose a career in science?**

* funding models need to change. Don't fund men who have dodgy histories.

* enable anonymous reporting and store data in one place, if multiple women complain over a time period to an app or something then serial offenders can be found out

* have clear policies, have a code of conduct, have processes in place.

* collect statistics like they did in that SAFE study, do this across all levels of the university.

I don't know if I were an actual engineer if the energy would be bad, but I lucked out. Mostly I think it is due to the culture as a start up, the management have daughters my age so there's always that lens. Also my coworkers have healthy relationships with their moms and sisters and those who have wives. They mention them in passing in positive light. I am not joking, and it's so weird? But it's great too because they're open about it. That might be a green flag to look for? 

I'm not harassed here by anyone and lucky that my manager and former manager (shifted roles) takes that seriously. But I'm excluded. Because even my friendly coworkers are filtering what they say around me and it's not awful things but like using the word bitch for example. I'm never invited outside work events and how would that go? They still like bars and ""everyone"" knows how risky that is even if there are no predators among my coworkers. Also I was point blank told that I was the only woman in the office and the first one to join. 

That aside I think and hoped we'd recruit a female engineer, so I don't know maybe the pay is too low. Like, it'd be a great place in terms for her to learn. But we only had male applicants even for my role when a coworker quit. 

I was also the only female student for electronics though.

Mentioning this as a possible time for you to look elsewhere and maybe pros and cons of a start up environment. But at the same time, I know how rare this is too. My friend who works at a company corporation is having the full experiences of being a female in tech specifically the computer science majors / types (not being taken seriously, out numbered, excluded, bad jokes even not of her but ""females""). 

knowing and seeing prior work places poorly handle sexual harassment or enable it in minor ways was really scary for me to even consider the field.

I had also had to come to terms (at a point in my life not now) when I wanted to enlist in the military and the rape statistics. As well as women in blue collar trades.

I rambled a bit, but like I said to my friend in tech, I love learning from her. Not just how to handle crap, but the cool shit she knows! I compare to to when we didn't have female doctors, females in military, and now female in STEM.

If you're burnt out still lookout for yourself when you leave. Like what benefits can you max out? Gives you time to plan. Like, not everyone can tough it out ""forever"". Every single trades woman I spoke to told me they ALL had the 1 awful experience that made then reconsider the trades. It broke some. There's nothing wrong with leaving. You can't hurt yourself to be a symbolic role model even if you truly are.

I heard there's a female only repair shop in Oregon I think? That is run by only female trade workers.

I'm rambling,. But like, unlike the near past. I think we as a whole are finding or making our own niches. We do the work we do because we're passionate about it and we are able. If your line of work morphs into something adjacent I hope you find it instead of quitting flat out.

There's a line in the handmaid's tale like ""don't let the bastards grind you down"" or something like that.

I don't know. Personally I love finding and seeing real females in roles. Like wow. You're real! I actually said that to a trades woman and she looked at me like I was crazy, but she understood. She said in her 4 years working maybe 4/300 union trades workers she met were female.

I know you're not in the trades, but the similarity of ""is it worth it to put up with this anymore?"" rings true over there too.

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:32,2021-02-17 21:09,TheGreekMyths,Post,"Drowning, don't know how to ask for help",lmb3fz,,"Hello, this is a throwaway and I will try to be general as I talk about things. Apologies in advance for the wall of text.

**Basically, the crux of my problem is this:** I feel terrible at work and need *some* kind of help, but don't know what. I don't know how to ask for help because I don't know *what* to ask for.

I joined a small company about a year ago, I have about 2 years of software engineering experience under my belt. I still consider myself junior and have a lot of confidence issues around work, mainly because I feel like I haven't worked on anything meaty enough to really constitute software engineering (maybe that's normal for someone of my level?). 

Up to recently I have been receiving positive feedback on my work. I am a quick learner and performed well last year. I was praised for being ""resilient"" through a lot of company changes. I was promoted at the end of the year to a ""SWE II"" position. I like my coworkers.

The past 2 months have been disastrous for me at work. I'm working extremely slowly, for reasons I don't understand. I basically cry every day because I'm so frustrated with myself. I have weekly 1:1s with my manger and every time I tell him things are good because I don't know what to say 🙃 which I know is stupid. I haven't received any feedback on my work, no one is saying I'm doing a bad job or a good job, which makes me feel super paranoid that I am doing a bad job but they are not willing to tell me. I asked to transfer to a different team that was more inline with my interests with more challenging work, and the request was denied, which makes me feel like it was denied because they they think I am not capable of doing the work (which would make sense because I am working absurdly slowly on simple things right now). I make stupid mistakes in my code and I have another coworker that has gone and made PRs to fix my stuff after I make PRs, which makes me feel even worse. 

I feel like I'm just in a vicious cycle at work where I am bored/not engaged with my tickets, or find them frustrating because the context is not fully written up (I do go and seek out context), and so then I work slowly, and then I get worried about working slowly and how I'm not technical enough, which stresses me out, which makes me frustrated with my tickets. I don't know how to ask for help in this cycle. 

I guess another thing that I mentioned is that I'm worried about not being technical enough. I know there are many ways to be a good software engineer. I am personable. People like me. I ask good questions. I care about things being clear. I can sus out requirements. BUT I feel like I just haven't been given the opportunities to grow technically. Everything I've done is just tinkering with stuff other people have made. Maybe that is normal for a junior engineer. But I don't understand how I am supposed to know how to build larger systems if I've never even dipped my toes into anything. I am scared of being pigeonholed. I don't want to be part PM, part engineer. I just want to be an engineer. A senior engineer (not at my company) advised me to read [Glue Work](https://noidea.dog/glue) and then, while I'm still junior, *avoid doing glue work as much as possible so I can grow technically*. But I feel like I HAVE to do glue work because things are poorly defined. But at the same time, because I am not a lead, I don't have any of the real credibility or anything. So I feel like I'm being insubordinate by always asking ""Why are we prioritizing x? What about this cost for y? Do we need to do this?"".

Anyways I don't know how much of this issue is I just have low self esteem and am terrified of being fired, which is not really my manager's problem, it's a me problem, and how much is a real problem at work that I can ask for help for. This post was kind of to vent but if anyone has any advice it would be much appreciated because I feel like I'm losing it at work.

Stay out of other countries' shit. Don't start nothin', won't be nothin'. The guy who lets the other person throw the first punch always gets the benefit of the doubt. Afghanistan was a shitshow, but a justifiable one. Iraq, on the other hand....

If it doesn't affect me, do whatever the fuck you want.

You're entitled to your own beliefs, and people should respect and fight for your right to have them, but it's straight up unconstitutional to force them on others. IDGAF if we're viewed as a Christian, Muslim, Hebrew, Atheist, or Technocratic country, as long as you don't try to make me be one. And for god's sake, stop giving equal weight to all opinions on one side of an issue. If you're pro-life because you believe in a specific developmental stage that establishes personhood, I respect that opinion. If you're pro-life because God said so, then I have an obligation to not take you seriously, because it's already dangerous to legislate based on opinions and not facts, but at least most opinions have a logical reason behind them. But it's insane to legislate an un-provable opinion that requires blind faith. Science may one day unearth new evidence that sways public opinion on what constitutes life. But the only way you'll ever prove that God actually said so is if he comes back to Earth, at which point he could just fuckin tell you himself.

If 97% of the world's scientists agree on any topic, you should probably take their fucking word for it.

Unless you're Native American, ""American"" isn't an acceptable response for questions about your heritage. Fine, your grand or great grand or great great grandpappy came here long ago and you were born here, yadda yadda. Even if your ancestor was a fuckin founding father, we still all came from somewhere else. We are all immigrants and refugees, so it's kinda hypocritical to ignore a core tenet of what it means to be American. 

Legislating against immigrant workers won't save your job in the long run. If an immigrant can come here and take it from you, that means you probably either weren't very good at it, or they're willing to work for less (in my experience, master's degree or higher workers will get paid around the same amount, perhaps just a bit less), in which case salaries for your position would fall over time anyways. You get paid what the market will bear. Command more by working smarter and harder. 

""“Illness is neither an indulgence for which people have to pay, nor an offence for which they should be penalised, but a misfortune, the cost of which should be shared by the community” - Aneurin Bevan. Healthcare and Pharma should either be socialized, or MUCH more heavily regulated. Uber got crucified for insane surge pricing during natural disasters and profiting off of suffering. Medicine should be no different.

If a program or service works, who gives a fuck who came up with it or who provides it. There are countless examples of government programs that are better suited to the private sector, and plenty in the private sector that need to be subjected to government oversight and ethics. So the private sector can do it cheaper. Who gives a shit? Does it provide a public benefit? Can it be implemented with money they already have? Then do it, WHAT THE FUCK!!??!?

I'm rambling again, but those are just a few of the countless polarizing talking points with common sense solutions that lie somewhere in the middle. I actually sacreligiously (for Libs) share your belief that there are many government programs that work. But I also believe there are many that don't, or are perhaps better handled by states.

I did a bit of social sciences until I realized that 1. it gets you no money (except you are a token woman, haha) 2. it is full of feminist ideologues who are so far from reality that it is unbelievable. Otherwise I would say there are important and interesting parts in it minus the feminist ideology and token women and their stupid helpers. The ""Sokal affair"" changed nothing how they operate. It is even far worse nowadays than back then.

Throughout history matriarchies also didn't hold out and work that long. What we have nowadays is different: Men still do all the dangerous and dirty jobs but women want to control everything without taking any blame if everything goes wrong. Then men still do the dirty work (like fighting wars, cleaning up radioactive wastelands and so on) and women sit at home and love the fact that they control everything now without getting blame for anything. If female enrichment without any real work done is threatened, men will forcefully be sent to war once again and women will sit at home claiming they are somehow ""discriminated"" against.

Feminists ""fought"" for all of that. In reality, they just got all the imagined ""privileges"" men had without taking any of their (mostly deadly dangerous) responsibilities. They didn't even ""fight"", men gave them all of these things without any real fight. There was no war where loads of feminists died for gaining all of this, they got it without sacrifice. This applies to 1st, 2nd, or 3rd wave alike. They just wanted perceived ""privileges"" without responsibilities.

1st wanted voting rights for women at a time when almost no men were allowed to vote either (but were forced to go to war, just like today). To the contrary, very few men were allowed to vote (for example in the Prussian multi class voting system) and in a lot of places (sometimes until today, not applying to women) it was tied to conscription and fulfillment of military service. Women can now vote without any military service requirements. To the contrary, those ""Suffragettes"" back then helped the government to vilify all those men not going to war for various reasons as ""cowards"" (the ""white feather movement""). Just as always, feminists worked with the government, not against it.

2nd wave feminism wanted ""freedom"" paid by men without any obligations for them and permanent ""victimhood"" (a woman is never responsible for anything even if she committed the most heinous crimes). Women with sanity who called out the feminists sick and false ideology (like Esther Villar) were called a ""Nazi"" (while being a Jew in Germany) and threatened with murder by feminists until they fled the country. Erin Prizzey said women are just as violent as men and fled because she was threatened with murder too by feminists. Books like the ""SCUM manifesto"" are nowadays hailed as some kind of ""great art"" and the woman perpetrating attempted murder as ""not being part of feminism"".

3rd wave feminists nowadays want the maximum out of all of it and vilify men for everything imaginable under the sun. It serves them well and gives them access to massive amounts of money (paid by men of course) so they can live a good life at the expense of men. Nobody cares if men die more than 5 years earlier or get killed doing dangerous jobs no woman even considers doing. That must be the ""empathy"" feminists always claim women posses while it was men who helped women living in far better conditions than men nowadays.

I never heard a feminist saying they want the same obligations and duties men have to endure all the time. I never heard a feminist saying a female criminal should get the same identical punishment a man would get. To the contrary, women are always left off the hook for doing bad things. In reality, letting them off the hook is even more damaging to society because these women can bear and raise children and give their bad character to the next generation of people.

First of all, congrats on the (upcoming) degree! :D

> I started out doing mostly embedded stuff and ended up doing a combination of ML/DL stuff with some backend dev.

That's solid experience solely because of the ""programmed at a real company"", which is the number one thing junior dev applications are missing. That gives you a competitive edge already.

> I know 0 frontend languages / apis. Mostly familiar with java, c++, c, rust, python, haskell, and nix. Tend to be really bad at remembering syntax for various apis unless I use them constantly (e.g. pandas vs pytorch text). Familiar with git and docker. Not familiar with most CI/CD tools. Very familiar with unix based systems.

Diving into the quality of your experience, also looks fine. You can just articulate that you specialize in ""X and Y parts of the stack"", which doesn't include frontend. This does mean you should avoid ""full-stack"" positions if you don't want do frontend and maybe look for more ""backend"" or ""ML/AI engineer"" positions. Those last two are different, but you could take either fork in the road based on your exp.

Also on the ""familiar with unix based systems"", I didn't know there was an alternative haha. Well, I guess DoD does have RTOS / VxWorks and the occasional Windows-based app <shrug>

Oh, and I've forgotten more syntax than I ever thought I'd learn. Welcome to the club! ;)

> Since I'm technically a new grad, if I apply to a new job should I be applying to junior positions still? Or would I be better off applying to senior ones? Do I have to stick to DoD type jobs since I did classified work, or would it be doable to switch out?

Ok, now to answer the question you're looking for. I think you should interview for mid-level positions if you can. I wouldn't expect it to be easy, but I suspect that if you start interviewing and getting real feedback, you'll find that mid-level is maybe only a few months of focused prepping away.

There are some folks suggesting applying to senior roles, but I'd disagree. In a senior position you're expected to be fairly self-sufficient and also to be able to set an example for more junior folks. If you jump into this without having done the standard junior->mid->sr track, it might make it harder for you to learn on the transition. Another important aspect of the non-senior period is the freedom to make mistakes and learn -- you're still doing that as a senior, but access to mentorship gets more limited.

As for industry, if you want to do more DoD roles, go for it, but you're free to try any other sector if you wish. I personally try to avoid defense, gov, and commercial banking, because of the red tape. On the other hand, I know a lot of folks who go into those specifically because of the better work-life balance. If you can spare the effort, I'd suggest you interview at a broad spectrum of industries to get a feel for the different expectations and processes. 

This is more of a ""what do *you* like"" question :)

> What are the things I would need to do to stand out? Should I learn front end dev?

Be a very clear communicator and be very collaborative. There are plenty of smart people, so you're not going to differentiate yourself by that factor. But there are *not* so many people who would make great teammates, so that's a lot more important. You already have the basic tech skills, so that's why I'm suggesting this.

As for Front end dev, that's up to you. I don't think of myself as a front end dev in the slightest, but I find it fascinating so I'll pick up the occasional frontend feature. It's all about how you want to develop your skills... is front end an area you want to explore? If so, learn it. If not, pick something that you do want to do.

I've decided I want to pivot into tech as opposed to occupational therapy, interior design, industrial design, etc.

I'm looking for help identifying job titles, roles, and specific sections of the industry to look into.  I'm going to describe my skills a bit, and it's going to sound really full of myself, but if techbros can do it then I'm going to own the space, too. 

I know that I don't want to do GIS in a different industry. I was considering growing in GIS I tried to learn python from a few tutorials and I wanted to effing die. Learning the basics of SQL (in order to have conceptual understanding) was pretty fun, though. I'm thinking that hardcore coding and data analysis (divorced from visual/spatial analysis) aren't my happy place.  I have done management and I like the communication elements and going to bat for my team. I've also done tech support in a school computer lab before. It was a small role but I am A-okay with client-facing.


My aptitudes for inductive reasoning and analytical reasoning are 99th and 91st percentile. Idea generation is equally high and my visual+spatial skills are extremely robust. Applied problem solvers are MY PEOPLE because they tend to be highly verbal idea generators and I love that energy.  I'm creative, I'm a storyteller, I've got really high cognitive empathy, I'm great at seeing different viewpoints and level-setting my communication between difficulty levels. I think that I could do a good job as a technical salesperson because I'm good at convincing people of a viewpoint and I like relationship building, but not alllll of the relationships + gregarious extraversion like a more general sales person.

 I'm legitimately a quick study. I took one vanilla CAD class and made a civil drafting career. I pivoted into ArcMap and GIS on the job and with a book and a 3 day class.  I taught myself to sew and now I make couture pieces. I took one upholstery class to learn the basics and reupholstered my couch. 


I'm working hard to free myself from my family of origin's lesson that I am unacceptable because I have ADHD and I'm not an engineer.  I have a whole lot of skills and experience so I'm looking for options that don't involve traditional educational pathways and starting on the ground floor. Oh, and I am definitely someone who needs internships and immersive training rather than classroom training. Internet lecture videos are highly inefficient for getting information into my brain.

The ugly underbelly? I am ridiculously subjective. I don't think like other people and I enjoy producing unique and thoughtful work as opposed to working well as a cog in a machine or doing clerical-type work (I'm so subjective that I need to frequently remind myself to think of company goals).  All of my strong interests point to ART and all of my aptitudes point to STEM. I prefer to be given a box to think outside of rather than generate content according to a client's preferences. It makes me super anxious to sew for people because ""What if I do it perfectly and they don't like it?""... My level of subjectivity makes me hesitant towards pure marketing, but confident towards client relations because I like individualized everything LOL.   I have ADHD and I am very self-aware of what it means for my work. I'm totally willing to invest in coaching to help me develop and use the organization systems that will be required for me to succeed at a WFH role. 


Thanks for reading my parking lot sized post. I appreciate y'all and welcome questions. Hit me with any resources, other subreddits, contacts, etc to help me get a grasp of the career landscape in Tech. I know I come across confident, but I'm actually recently healed from bursting into tears at the topic of profession... from not knowing what I want to do and being really unhappy with my work and suuuuper ashamed of asking for help or dreaming big. I'm impressed with the tone of this subreddit and I'm so glad to have spaces like this where women support women.

ladydevs,top,2023-10-24 21:45,2018-05-17 16:36,babylock,Comment,"Women rarely counter-offer their salary, but listen, do it! Don’t be afraid to ask for more!",dz5fl2j,,"When I use “blame” I mean this

1.	Women should fix this because it is the result of their own lack of assertiveness and internalized sexism
2.	Businesses should fix this because their employees are punishing 

Blame = who is responsible 

I’m not sure that article’s a great refute.

Hoff Sommers fails to account for the fact that:

1.	No decisions are made in a bubble (society has some impact)

What is pushing young girls to pinkwashed professions (sexism)? What causes STEM’s “leaky pipeline?” Do women leave themselves or are they [pushed out](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/confronting-sexual-harassment-in-science/)?

2.	It is hard to make a decision without coercion of some kind in our society (using this term loosely)

Is the decision to pursue factory labor in a third world country made without coercion? What if it kills you over time, but it’s the only job available. What if fruit picking pays below minimum wage, but it’s the only job that won’t check your citizenship? Is that decision made totally free? What if your husband refuses to do childcare for your 10 kids (so leaving him doesn’t seem like an option because you can’t support them on your own), so your options are 1. (let’s exaggerate this to make the point) store manager (terrible hours) or 2. home health worker (worse pay, shift labor). You can’t choose the better paying job because that would mean no one supervising your kids, and home health worker is paid less than daycare would cost so you “choose” stay at home mom. Was that really a decision? 

This is why people argue that female equality (of which equal pay is one facet) requires a systemic effort. It’s more than the individual, heck, it’s more than the business—it’s society wide! 

It requires [childcare to be subsidized or early education to be free](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/19/17018380/gender-wage-gap-childcare-penalty). [It requires paternal leave.](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/45782/1/623752174.pdf) as [parental leave isn’t enough](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24219.pdf) 

3.	Professions originally blue-washed (computer science) and pinkwashed (nursing) tend to have pay that fluctuates based on whether the field is female or male coded. As women left computer science, pay increased, as men became nurses, pay decreased. This is true in other countries (Saudi Arabia) where the perception of the predominant gender in a field (computer science) is different than the USA.

4.	Even if decisions were made in a bubble, the consequence that this decision should result in a dock in pay does not automatically follow. (There has to be a second factor which argues the decision for this to result in a doc in pay is valid.) 

Of course, if you work fewer hours, you should earn less pay. However, why has society determined that it makes sense to effectively penalize women for “choosing” (whether this is true” to care for a family? 

Other countries have paid leave. Other countries offer subsidized childcare or free lower education. The decision to force women out of the workforce disproportionately to care for children and relatives has a clear solution, and clear negative consequences. For example, to avoid the associated pay cut with having children, [Japanese women are refusing to marry and have children](http://paa2009.princeton.edu/papers/90537). If countries want to encourage child rearing, they need to address these pitfalls to having children which result in reductions to women’s lifetime earnings. 

The pay cut might not result from some scheming businessman rubbing his hands together and paying women less, but it does result from sexism:

Women punished for negotiating 

Women groomed/socialized to be unassertive (gender roles)

Women’s disproportionately responsible for childcare 

Childcare (women’s work) is uncompensated and seemingly not valued by society (where’s maternal and paternal leave minimums? Free lower education?)

Pinkwashed jobs earning less

The issue is more nuanced than Hoff Sommers would like us to believe.

womenintech,hot,2023-10-24 20:14,2023-08-10 23:20,DataDrivenJellyfish,Comment,Am I an idiot?,jvoke3w,,"I agree with others - asking for help is not a shame. I would say the opposite, spending too much time stuck because you're embarrased to ask for help is no good and sometimes better save the time and share your issue with somebody. 

That being said, maybe you should work on both your perception and the way you're looking for solution. 

Perception - you say you can't think about anything else when you're stuck - I understand that even after the work hours it's bothering you. It happens, sometimes the problem consumes you so much. But like others have mentioned - that's the developer life and we all get stuck with something annoying every now and then. That's why we get paid so much - we're dealing with complex problems and complex systems. And it's hard! And that's ok to get frustrated over a problem. But it's important to remember that like any other task, you'll find a solution and move on. That's just how it goes. So maybe try to tell yourself that that's fine, nothing is wrong with you. Just let it go for the evening. 

Something between perception and action - how you frame the problem. Looks like your framing is something like ""I don't know anything, how come I'll become a senior"". But clearly you do know something 🤷🏻‍♀️ Try to figure out what *exactly* it is that you don't know. Try to narrow it down. Maybe you're not familiar with some tool and it doesn't behave the way you expect and you're seeing some strange error. Maybe it expects a file in some location and doesn't find it. Maybe you're not sure what is this location it is expecting at all (I'm recalling the grief docker gave me when I just learned it haha). I hope you kinda get where I'm going with that. Try to isolate the specific little thing that you ""don't know"" and then you'll feel less stupid. And you'll feel better about asking for help on a specific question and not ""oh I've no idea what's going on"". Not saying you've no idea, it's just to illustrate!

Then, there's the technique how to actually look for solutions. Debugging is an art, it comes with experience but also needs some imagination sometimes. I'll try to list some examples, some of them dumb, I'll probably won't remember many good examples, but at least something. Maybe you ladies can help here as well. 

Example 1: your program gives a weird error. Google the error string! (Ok that's an obvious one). 

Example 2: you're given a task and you don't know where to start - you more or less understand how it needs to be done but when trying to think about details your brain gets lost. Instead of thinking just try to hack something up in an ugly unoptimized way. Often when you start doing *something* suddenly things become more clear. 

Example 3: you're given a task but you have no idea really how it's done. It's a new codebase or whatever. For example (I'm a frontend dev mainly haha) you need to make a dialog open that then calls an API. 
You need to find out what's the endpoint like. You need to find where in the code to put the button that will open the dialog. You need to find out where the data the dialog needs is gonna come from. Each of these questions is a separate ""task"" and if you stuck in one of them, you can continue on the others while waiting for an answer for example. That will make you feel like you're not stuck on the whole project. 

Trying to figure out how the api needs to be called? Look for similar cases in the code. Search the code by the url. Etc. 

In general when you divide the problem to separate problems, it help to 1) focus better at one at a time 2) map what you ""really"" miss and what are the many other pieces of the puzzle you *do* know. That helps feel in control. 

Example 4: you wrote some code and now everything broke. (Story of my life). Try to stash changes and then add them one by one to figure out what piece has caused it. 

If I'm talking rubbish and the examples are silly, I'm sorry. The point is, that's dev's life. Sometimes we have really annoying issues. The idea is 1) to realize you not ""know nothing"" but just lack couple puzzle pieces and 2) to improve your debugging/problem solving techniques to identify what these missing pieces are.

I am currently unemployed after being fired without any notice, no verbal or written warning, no performance improvement plan, just pulled into a meeting and fired.  Kinda struggling with feelings of worthlessness since then.  I am just here to tell what happened and see if this was a toxic environment or not.

I am a data engineer with three years of experience.  I only have an associate's degree, but I have enough working experience to be a solid engineer.  I am still working on my bachelor's since I transferred my credits to UCD in January 2020 and the pandemic derailed my dream.

When I was first hired on, I was working underneath one Head of Technology.  When he left three months in, he pulled me onto a zoom call and made me the acting head of technology and then asked me out for drinks.  I declined because I was very open about my sobriety and I had a partner.

I was the only woman on the technology team.  When I got there I was working across from a man who seemed to have some problems working with me.  I pulled him in to our first zoom meeting and try to be nice, he is very terse and sends me 5000 lines of code in a jupyter notebook.  No comments, no walkthrough, just here you go.  I went through that code and found that he was importing libraries and building a database connection in each function call.  When I brought up to him that his code was inefficient, he said I was difficult to work with.  I was given my own data providers and we were basically siloed away from each other, each of us using our own methods to ingest data and not communicating across teams.  He also would not get on board for my ideas for automation and I had to build a proof of concept for HIS data providers.  They were always talking about AI but we were having trouble getting a conventional product out the door. 

The head of analytics was super flirtatious and undermined my experience at every suggestion.  I was trying to get us using best practices, there was no consistent naming convention or established work flow.  I remember pointing to a spot in a SQL Queries for Mere Mortals on a zoom call with him trying to get him to take what I was saying seriously but it was like talking to a brick wall.  I felt like he was talking to me like a silly girl instead of a female colleague.  When I said that I was starting online classes for my bachelor's again, he scoffed at the idea and got a little angry.  He sent me winky faces, made zoom calls very uncomfortable, said ""God DAMN, <name>"" right behind me during an work event and got terse and irritable with me when I made suggestions for how to do things better.  When I saw the amount of technical debt we were accumulating, he said I was ""being negative.""

Despite this, I built an automated airflow ETL pipeline from scratch to ingest 2.7 billion records, got an AWS certification and received a diversity award at the company retreat.

When we hired on the new head of technology, he seemed to have a really off putting demeanor.  I remember interviewing him and he was not my first or even second choice but we needed someone.  He snapped at me a few times, didn't champion my accomplishments and seemed.... awful... like he would make petty comments about overseas outsourcing and how his wife hated that he can eat whatever he wanted without gaining weight.

One day, about three months after he was hired on, he just pulled me into a meeting and fired me.  No warnings, no performance improvement plan, just fired.  I am still struggling with feelings of worthlessness and a loss of confidence.  Kinda just wish I was put on a performance improvement plan so I could have been looking for work.

I am honest with recruiters about what happened to me and they seem to blame me for it, like I deserved this or I am just being a complainer.  This happened to me and I hate it.  I hate that this organization seemed so sexist and misogynistic and I need to pretend like the sun shines directly out of my ass despite my experience.

I hate to feel like this from a stupid job, and that this looks poorly on me as a professional.  I can work on things that are brought to my attention but this feels malicious and toxic.

...

I've been in the tech industry for 20 years. I started in tech support and worked my way up, doing onsite support and more tech support and finally landed a job as a ""technology specialist"" (basically, IT generalist/help desk) a little over seven years ago at a nonprofit. It's a medium sized employer, close to 1000 people work there in a few states. The whole time I've been there, I've been working my way up. I became the agency's first ""specialist 2"" and then the first (and so far only) specialist 3.  Everything I've achieved in my career has been through my hard work and determination; I had no formal education in IT until 2 years ago I started a certificate program at a local community college, where after a year and a half, I earned some certificates, finally. 

Hopefully in this community it goes without saying that throughout my entire career I've experienced people doubting my capability, doubting my skill, doubting my knowledge, and even doubting that I hold my actual title, from my first few jobs in tech support (""now that you've taken my name and phone number and noted my issue, can you transfer me to the tech, honey?"") to contractors and vendors whom I've worked with at my current job showing up and asking me straight out, incredulously, ""YOU are the 'IT guy'?""

A little over a year ago, when I was almost done with school, our agency's system administrator left the agency. I asked to be considered for the job. I and a (male) coworker...who hadn't asked to be considered for the job but was asked by a manager to try out for it... were given the opportunity to be ""co-interim sys admins"". We were told a decision would be made after six months. Instead, after six months, we were asked to continue as we were for ""more time."" When it had been almost a year since we'd entered the ""co-interim"" roles, management changed, and suddenly I had a boss who supported me moving up and recognized the hard work I'd done. He pushed for me to be promoted to sys admin and my coworker to return to his specialist role. All the paperwork was in order, people just needed to sign it.... And then COVID-19 happened. Everything was aflurry with trying to get the whole agency transitioned to working from home. And then: a hiring freeze and a promotion freeze were announced. Somehow, my boss pulled off a miracle, and pushed my promotion through; it helped that all the paperwork was in place and that I'd performed the role without the title/pay for over a year and was overdue the promotion.

I was happy. I am happy. And yet....

My boss is hesitant to announce my role change because of the freezes, and the budget cuts. And I get it, but I still want to be recognized for working my butt off, and I still want, within the agency, the recognition that my role is different and I work at a different level that requires a higher amount of expertise and knowledge and that I really can be in the room when the grownups are talking because I'm one of them.

My boss announced my role change to the rest of the IT team about two weeks after it went through. He had said he was going to announce it to the leadership team, and to the people I used to (and often still do) directly support, as well as the HR team, but he has yet to do that, and it's been about six weeks now. Also, we have an intranet page that lists the whole IT team, and I had to ask the guy who maintains it to change my title (he is a member of the IT team and was aware of the change and so did change it), but no one has asked for my male coworker's title to be altered so even though I'm listed as sys admin, he's still listed as ""interim sys admin"". 

Am I being petty? Am I focusing too much on small details and should just get over it and worry about doing my job well? My husband says the only things that matter are my title and paycheck and if those are correct then I shouldn't care what anyone else knows or thinks about my title or position. He says outside of IT no one will really even understand the difference anyway, and that I'm just hoping for extra pats on the back if I want to have it announced in some way.

xxstem,hot,2023-10-24 23:52,2020-03-11 7:36,thewhat,Comment,Struggling a Little,fk73jv3,,"I don't know where you are and what you're options are, I also don't have much experience since I'm a PhD student myself, but it sounds to me like you don't *just* need to vent. It sounds like you need someone on your side that understands you. You sound like a very considerate person - everything you say is followed by explanations for why your PI acts like she does and that you understand her, yet you don't get any understanding back. That's very nice of you, and at the same time very unbalanced and probably taxing for you. No wonder you're feeling down - this is a shitty situation and you've done everything right. It's not your fault your PI didn't follow through on her promises. I don't blame you for feeling hopeless. 

From personal experience though, I can say that there definitely ARE labs that are good at accommodating people with various disabilities. They may be hard to find, or you may have to move to work there (I'm in Sweden, for example), but you're definitely not doomed if you want to continue in research. I myself have had struggles due to a suspected autism diagnosis, but thanks to a good therapist and an understanding PI I've been able to adjust both schedule, work flow and the workspace so that it works for me. I am currently working with a person newly diagnosed with ADHD who got a lot of help from the University to figure out how to structure their work in order to reach their goals as well, and I work with a professor with dwarfism who has been here for decades. My other PI (yeah, I have two) I even suspect has autism themselves. No one comments on any of these things, except maybe to ask if you need help if they think you may be struggling and you're a new student.


I'm mentioning this only to say that there are places that would welcome you and help you out, and that your experience so far isn't proof that you're not a good researcher. Your PI sounds inexperienced and overwhelmed, and it was unfortunate that you ended up with her when she obviously can't cope with the situation she's found herself in. You deserve more. I think that you may need some outside support so that you get an idea of what to tell her when asking for accommodations. Maybe you need a therapist/occupational therapist, or some other type of mentor who could help you go through all the things you need so that you can just turn up with a finished list of things and how to do them. That way she wouldn't have to spend time trying to figure out how to fulfill your needs, and instead just do exactly what you ask. It would probably also help you to be able to raise all of your questions and needs in a neutral environment before having to go to her, if you think she may be judging you for the things you tell her. 

When I was having a hard time, the thing that helped me the most was finding a therapist with whom I could go through all of my struggles and find practical solutions that could work in my situation. I needed confirmation both that my struggles were real, that they were worth taking seriously (for me AND for others), exactly what I needed to change in order for me to work effectively, and practical tips on how to ask for accommodations when the people around me didn't know what I was struggling with. I understand the frustrating disconnect between needing accommodation to be productive, and seeming needy or like a burden for asking, even though you're actually being less productive when you can't get the help you need. That's why I think presenting her with the solutions to your problems in a prepared form could be good - it seems more like you're being proactive.  


This got long, but my message is, in essence :


1. See if you can find someone to discuss your struggles with that is not your PI. Find out exactly what you need, if possible, and see if presenting a finished list of your own solutions works better than discussing your struggles with her directly.

2. If you think you need to change labs in the future, there are good labs out there. Your experiences so far doesn't mean there's no place for you in science, or just means it's harder to find the right place for you and you've had bad luck.



Lastly, if you do decide that you don't want to continue in science, there is no shame in that. It's completely understandable because it is a competitive field, and maybe you decide that the sacrifices you'd have to make to make it work are too big. Just don't blame yourself for it. You deserve to be somewhere where you can be comfortable, and your requirements are not unrealistic.

You just want to be right no matter what, which is why you are trying to shut down this conversation because you know are worried my argument may stengthen (maybe, or it may weaken... Depends on the data, now doesn't it?) as I uncover more data. YOU don't want to have to admit to being wrong. The 4.8% figure is ALSO part of ""the data"" and it is also the most publicly available data (because it's what is published on Wikipedia, so that's what most people will see) and was the only one I was aware of until I read this study. I'm trying to figure out why this number (1.7%) is way lower than the more widely-known number (4.8%). I think that definitely requires more data and research. Saying the 1.7 figure is ""right"" and the 4.8 figure is ""wrong"" would be doing EXACTLY what you accused me of: looking for data to justify your position. Maybe the 1.7 is right. Maybe it's 1.5? Maybe it's 5.3? I'm still looking into it. I'm gonna go get more info on these studies, and look at more studies.

Questioning the validity of other elements of this study (not dismissing them, but being a bit skeptical) is quite reasonable (again, I'm NOT dismissing the data... I don't think they are bald-faced lying about the results) since they are not differentiating forced vaginal sex from consentual so long as you are drunk/high/drugged/unconscious. Like I said this is (was?) legit, prosecutable rape in California. This is a common argument that would not hold up at most cocktail parties and water coolers (and probably anywhere that isn't super-liberal) and only works in court because it is codified into the law. Even then, like I said, it DIDN'T work, because that would make most of the population both a rape victims AND a rape perpetrator. And notice the other questions in that same question block add the term forced or say that someone made you do it... Except for the vaginal part, or the oral part(s). Interesting. Very suspicious that they didn't add the word ""forced"" to the vaginal part. Is there something about vaginal sex that makes it extra ""rapey"" versus anal? Hell, if anything, if you are gonna call all of a certain type of sex rape so long as you are drug-alcohol addled, I would go for anal, not vaginal, wouldn't you? Same with the mouth on the penis thing. Why didn't they ask about coercion there? Or have a separate question for each, one for forced and one for consentual? Oh that's right, because drunken sex can't be consentual, according to their definition. This is exactly what you would do if you wanted to turn fairly normal things into ""rape"" so that you could throw up higher numbers to scare people, but have a defensible excuse (it wasn't consensual because they were ""impaired,"" therefore rape).

So this makes me want to go through every single bit of this study with a fine-toothed comb and a slightly skeptical eye. Going into this, did you think you would be considered a rapist AND a rape victim? I bet not. Are you, according to this study? I bet so. Do I think you are/were ACTUALLY raped? No, and neither does anybody you know, probably, using this study's twisted criteria for ""consent.""

Can you imagine asking someone that just slept with a hot chick at a frat party if they were raped and having them answer ""yes because I was drunk?""

I can't even fathom that.

Think about it. 19%? I bet you know 100 women. Do you REALLY THINK 20 of those women were legit raped? It seems artificially high to me.

Just so you know I am going to continue looking into the data, and will probably read another 20-30 more studies before I even begin to think that I have a solid comprehension of the subject. There are just so many variables here... This is not an easy thing. I mean 1.7 versus 4.8? That's a huge difference.

Time to figure out why! Were the 4.8% people flat-out lying? I bet not. I mean 4.8% is still slightly under 1 in 20, but it is almost 3x higher than 1.7, so, I'm off to figure out what the deal with that is.

When I said that the number seems more like 11%, I wasn't talking about a different study. I was talking about the same study, but not including the ""drug facilitated"" part (which was about 9%). I'm still trying to figure out how they calculated the 11% (the average of 10-12%) in their data-set. Try called it ""forced completed penetration"" in the study, and 11% of women reported that happening at least once in their lifetime.

The devil is in the details on this study FOR SURE, because they are clearly calling things rape that others (including you and I) would not think they are talking about when they say ""rape.""",4673,gendered split perception,,,try find data support position want right matter try shut conversation know worried argument may stengthen maybe may weaken depends data uncover data want admit wrong 4 8 figure also part data also publicly available data publish wikipedia people see one aware read study try figure number 1 7 way low widely know number 4 8 think definitely require data research say 1 7 figure right 4 8 figure wrong would exactly accuse look data justify position maybe 1 7 right maybe 1 5 maybe 5 3 still look gon na go get info study look study question validity element study dismiss bit skeptical quite reasonable dismiss data think bald face lie result since differentiate force vaginal sex consentual long drunk high drug unconscious like say legit prosecutable rape california common argument would hold cocktail party water cooler probably anywhere super liberal work court codify law even like say work would make population rape victim rape perpetrator notice question question block add term force say someone make except vaginal part oral part interest suspicious add word force vaginal part something vaginal sex make extra rapey versus anal hell anything gon na call certain type sex rape long drug alcohol addle would go anal vaginal mouth penis thing ask coercion separate question one force one consentual oh right drunken sex consentual accord definition exactly would want turn fairly normal thing rape could throw high number scare people defensible excuse consensual impaired therefore rape make want go every single bit study fine toothed comb slightly skeptical eye go think would consider rapist rape victim bet accord study bet think actually rap neither anybody know probably use study twist criterion consent imagine ask someone sleep hot chick frat party rap answer yes drink even fathom think 19 bet know 100 woman really think 20 woman legit rap seem artificially high know go continue look data probably read another 20 30 study even begin think solid comprehension subject many variable easy thing mean 1 7 versus 4 8 huge difference time figure 4 8 people flat lie bet mean 4 8 still slightly 1 20 almost 3x high 1 7 figure deal say number seem like 11 talk different study talk study include drug facilitate part 9 still try figure calculate 11 average 10 12 data set try call force complete penetration study 11 woman report happen least lifetime devil detail study sure clearly call thing rape others include would think talk say rape,0.465897915,Objective

I'm wondering if it's partly due to me not recognizing some of my skills... but I'm very wary of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

I'm a software developer with 5 years experience. 4 of those years were in aerospace composites process modelling - i.e. developing software that simulates the processes involved in manufacturing carbon fiber parts for spaceships and airplanes. A lot of what I did there involved doing stuff with data. I also have a science background, and some previous science-y work experience, that involved some data-y stuff.

I recognize this does not make me a data analyst or data scientist! But I've done some stuff that \*appears\* to match descriptions of some of the tasks that are part of data analysis.

I made a list of stuff I've done that sounds (perhaps naively) like data analysis. I would really appreciate any feedback you have on whether the stuff I did ""counts"", whether I can legitimately claim to have data analysis skills - and whether I should!

&#x200B;

data collection

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_analysis#Data\_collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis#Data_collection)

\- I did this at \[groundwater scientist job\] (e.g. gathered hydrometric data from FortisBC, and put it into Excel), and programmatically at \[aerospace dev job\] (I think any time I wrote something that ""slurped in"" data from e.g. a csv file)

&#x200B;

data processing

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_analysis#Data\_processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis#Data_processing)

\- I did this at \[groundwater scientist job\] ""by hand"" - organizing data into specific structures in Excel spreadsheets

&#x200B;

data cleansing

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing)

\- I did this at \[groundwater scientist job\] ""by hand"" in Excel: finding & flagging missing entries, duplicate entries, outlier values (flagging outliers for reanalysis)

\- also did a bit of this programmatically at \[aerospace dev job\] - I remember detecting & removing missing values (from NumPy arrays, or Pandas dataframes - I don't remember which)

&#x200B;

data transformation

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation)

\- I did lots of this at \[aerospace dev job\], programmatically (e.g. extracting certain ranges of data from a NumPy array or Pandas dataframe or one of our legacy data formats, and putting them into some other arrangement)

&#x200B;

data modelling

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model)

\- I did a little bit of this at \[web dev bootcamp\], \[ISP dev internship\] & \[aerospace dev job\] (making ERDs, planning out database schemas).

\- Would this also include modelling e.g. plots & plot data in classes & attributes, like I did at \[aerospace dev job\] (when I developed the plotting module)? If so, I've done lots of data modelling

&#x200B;

data visualization

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization)

\- I visualized data by making charts & graphs in Excel at \[groundwater scientist job\], and lots of other times for school (e.g. most lab writeups)

\- I did data visualization programmatically at \[web dev bootcamp\] as part of a demo project. At \[aerospace dev job\]... would it be more accurate to say I \*built tools for\* data visualization? I designed & built the plotting module!

\- Oh also at \[chandelier warehouse logistics job\]! I did data collection, processing, cleansing and visualizing data - all in Excel

&#x200B;

data analysis in general

\- I did get a little bit of formal training in data analysis, while getting my bachelor degree in physics. (That was a while ago though - I graduated from that university in 2007!)

\- Intro to Statistics - would this count as statistical data analysis?

\- Physics Tools: Experiment - data analysis is in the course description: ""The following experimental tools and techniques are explored: Instrumentation; Fourier series; Data analysis; building AC and DC circuits; Detection and production of ultrasonic, acoustic, visible, microwaves; Mechanical systems.""

\- Computational Methods in Physics - computational/numerical data analysis, in Python: ""Topics include an overview of numerical analysis, the use of symbolic computation packages with applications to the modelling of physical phenomena, and the treatment of experimental or theoretical data""

Please let me know what you think! Thank you!

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:21,2023-10-03 19:17,Byeuji,Post,"Protecting women's and non-binary people's voices in tech spaces, and the future of this community (cont'd)",16z6w31,,"###GHC is over, but it ain't over

First up, GHC is over, so we've disabled the annual automod controls around discussions of GHC until next year. And that's especially important this year, because the regulars of the community will know already that we had some fiery conversations over the last week about what happened at GHC. 

### The conversation must continue

One particular thread became a proxy location to hash out what had occurred at GHC, and as difficult as it was to read and engage in (especially with all the transphobe sealions and community invaders trying to distract the conversation), it *was* a conversation that needs to take place. 

And unfortunately, while the moderators were working to keep the conversation as-civil-as-as-reasonable, while also allowing folks to vent very well-founded frustration over the invasion of our spaces at GHC, while being further invaded in this space, the **reddit admins** decided to step in and remove the thread entirely, as well as dozens of comments within the thread. 

### Reddit bowed to TERFs but we won't let it stand

So the reddit community team saw all the false reports of sexism and misogyny coming in from transphobes on the thread last week, and decided that even though the moderators were being extremely active in the thread, it warranted removal under reddit's content policies.

We didn't take that lying down. Thankfully, I have a position of privilege as a moderator on the Reddit Mod Council, and I was able to get the attention few moderators are able to get from the admins on this site. They apologized to us for the mistake, and have restored [the thread]( https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/comments/16vkyl5/what_are_yalls_opinions_on_cis_men_crashing/) (which remains locked, by the choice of our mods).


So we want to let /u/Free_Ad_2780 know that the removal of that thread was not done at the request of, or in cooperation with, the moderators of this subreddit. It was done without our knowledge or approval, and we've managed to get reddit to restore it with an apology attached for its removal. 

### /r/GirlsGoneWired supports diversity and inclusion

A lot of these conversations have been about how can we support our under-represented communities in these events, and protect them from being exploited by over-represented groups. 

What happened at GHC was cis men exploiting a resource and taking it from the people who it was designed to help. The poster of the thread linked above related the inability to access those resources to situations where organizations are trying to support racial diversity, but are unable to prevent people from non-marginalized races to access them.

This is what /r/GirlsGoneWired was created for. 

To be clear, if you come here and think that you can Matt Walsh it up by saying ""you can't excluse cis men from an event because you can't distinguish them from trans women"", you're a transphobe, that's a lazy argument, and you don't belong here. 

I am a trans woman, and I built this community along with my cis friends, and you will not stop us from being successful. We will ban you, and I will enjoy it.

### Reddit is not in this with us

Honestly, as much as I love creating communities for women, and as much as I love banning transphobes and misogynists, as I said several months ago, reddit is not here for us, and I just have so much trouble finding the energy to give this community the attention it deserves.

You all might be shocked to learn that I sent out invitations to a half dozen applicants for a moderator role, and none of them accepted. Only one even acknowledged they'd received the invite.

I don't blame them. The reddit app absolutely sucks, and I fully believe that they had no idea I sent them an invitation. 

Thankfully, some of you are quite active in the modmail with this team, and I decided to invite one particular moderator on a lark, and they've been kicking ass in the comments since they came on. Thank you /u/PhoenicianKiss.

I don't have faith that reddit is the forever-home for a community like ours. This week, reddit's automations failed our community. They accepted the will of the TERFs, failed to understand the nuanced arguments of the conversation, and overrode the will of the moderators and this community, and damaged our ability to discuss these events while they were pertinent. 

### Let's talk

So we're opening the floor for conversation -- this community needs mods, so let's talk about mods. I'd love to pass the baton on this subreddit, but I don't want to leave you all unguarded from malicious actors, because without my tenure and connections as a moderator of over a decade, we wouldn't have been able to restore that thread like we did today. We wouldn't have gotten an apology from reddit. But I also don't have the time and energy to give this community what it needs, and I don't want to leave it in PhoenicianKiss's lap and nope out. 

And let's talk about what happened at GHC, and with these other orgs and events. How do we protect women's spaces while ensuring they remain inclusive to trans and non-binary identities?

And above all else, **please use the report button and modmail**, it's the best way to notify us mods that something is up that needs addressing.

girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:16,2022-12-02 17:29,Instigated-,Comment,Salary Negotiation,iyog5up,,"I did a bootcamp because I weighed up and evaluated all my options for my situation, and continued to review and reassess my options along the way:

When I decided to reskill I had to juggle it against parenting responsibilities and a child with unpredictable health issues which could make it difficult to be somewhere at a certain time with any reliability. This meant in the first instance I needed something self paced. This cancelled out formal studies.

So I started self learning using free resources online. Did this for 9 months. It was a real struggle as there is no support or feedback when you get stuck or don’t understand anything, and when learning to code from ground zero you don’t yet have the “base” to build off. It wasn’t the most efficient way to learn, but I did the best with my circumstances.

My child’s health got a little better and gave me a bit more option to do something beyond self learning.

Where I live, the structured learning options were:
- university. Already have post grad qualifications in my previous career and still have debt from that, didn’t want to run up more debt, didn’t want to waste time with essays and exams, slow pace of learning, big upfront commitment, uni teaches a different tech stack (more geared to older enterprise type companies), curriculum doesn’t keep pace with industry, takes a somewhat broad generalist approach to teaching a little of everything even though different careers need different things and a lot won’t be used.

- trade college/community college style. These provide certificates. Due to it being a targeted skill I could have studied here free. But for tech it’s a shadow of uni, dumbed down, only teaches the very basics, has exams and essays and “checkbox” learning, slow pace of learning, not the desired tech stack, out of touch with industry. Even though I could do it free it didn’t look like a good use of my time.

- bootcamp. Intensive fast paced learning, specific to the role and tech stack, highly industry aligned (designed with consultation of local industry needs), I found a bootcamp run by not for profit so it was free, much more practically applied skills and learning, and they also wrapped it with career coaching and support.

- I knew from past experience that you learn more on the job, of directly relevant skills and knowledge, than any formal education can prepare you for. All I needed was to learn enough to get that first job. And then I would learn the rest while working and do additional self learning in my free time.

What was going to be the best use of my time, deliver the skills I needed, and get me to my goal fastest? Bootcamp. 

The problem with your thinking is that you are generalising and saying “bootcamp  is x” and “cs grads are y” and that is BS. It’s the same as saying “Americans are x, and Canadians are y”… or any other bias and stereotypes against any group. 

Fact is that universities don’t put out enough CS graduates to fill all the jobs the tech industry needs, nor do they align their degrees to employer needs, so many employers hire non cs grads. At entry level employers have a lot of choice, and they weigh up their needs and whether each individual candidate can meet those needs.

You seem to think that “passion” is the most important thing. It’s not. I had plenty of passion for my past career, as did many who entered that profession, but that didn’t make people good to work with, and over time passion dims to pragmatism as there are many challenges in the workplace that come down to stuff like teamwork, collaboration, communication, problem solving, ego, workplace politics, workplace culture, organisation, process, innovation, initiative, grit, resilience… the behavioural skills, values and attitudes that people have who you work alongside. 

Part of being a good employer is knowing how to get shit done even if it isn’t always fun or enjoyable or spark “passion”. Because even if you love your work generally speaking, some of it isn’t going to be fun, a lot to work needs to be done even if no one wants to do it, at times you will be asked to do things (expected, required) that you hate. If you only run on “passion” you won’t be able to do this stuff, will procrastinate, make excuses, fail.

And honestly, in my experience that’s what a lot of bootcamp grads bring - often have reskilled and have years of previous work experience with desirable behavioural skills, are pragmatic, adaptable, resilient, willing to challenge themselves beyond their comfort zone to learn new things, low ego, eager to get started on a real work asap, and have a very good sense of themselves (strengths, weaknesses, what will be a good match).

I’m not saying “all bootcamp grads” are this, as of course every individual in bootcamp or uni is going to be their own person. 

And that is my point - your bigotry is unfounded and unnecessary. 

I suspect it makes you feel better about yourself and puffs up your ego to look down on others… which perhaps only reveals an underlying insecurity (why do you need to go to war with bootcamp grads?) that would be better healed in other ways.

If you don’t check that attitude, you may find it hard in your career as you’ll likely work alongside bootcamp grads and your disdain for them will show through and that will reflect badly on you.",5420,gendered split perception,,,bootcamp weigh evaluate option situation continue review reassess option along way decide reskill juggle parent responsibility child unpredictable health issue could make difficult somewhere certain time reliability mean first instance need something self pace cancel formal study start self learn use free resource online 9 month real struggle support feedback get stick understand anything learning code ground zero yet base build efficient way learn best circumstance child health get little good give bit option something beyond self learn live structure learning option university already post grad qualification previous career still debt want run debt want waste time essay exams slow pace learn big upfront commitment uni teach different tech stack gear old enterprise type company curriculum keep pace industry take somewhat broad generalist approach teach little everything even though different career need different thing lot use trade college community college style provide certificate due target skill could study free tech shadow uni dumbed teach basic exams essay checkbox learn slow pace learning desire tech stack touch industry even though could free look like good use time bootcamp intensive fast pace learn specific role tech stack highly industry align design consultation local industry need find bootcamp run profit free much practically applied skill learn also wrap career coach support know past experience learn job directly relevant skill knowledge formal education prepare need learn enough get first job would learn rest work additional self learn free time go best use time deliver skill need get goal fast bootcamp problem think generalise say bootcamp x c grad bs say american x canadian bias stereotype group fact universities put enough c graduate fill job tech industry need align degree employer need many employer hire non c grad entry level employer lot choice weigh need whether individual candidate meet need seem think passion important thing plenty passion past career many enter profession make people good work time passion dims pragmatism many challenge workplace come stuff like teamwork collaboration communication problem solve ego workplace politics workplace culture organisation process innovation initiative grit resilience behavioural skill value attitude people work alongside part good employer know get shit do even always fun enjoyable spark passion even love work generally speak go fun lot work need do even one want time ask thing expect required hate run passion able stuff procrastinate make excuse fail honestly experience lot bootcamp grad bring often reskilled year previous work experience desirable behavioural skill pragmatic adaptable resilient willing challenge beyond comfort zone learn new thing low ego eager get start real work asap good sense strength weaknesses good match say bootcamp grad course every individual bootcamp uni go person point bigotry unfounded unnecessary suspect make feel good puff ego look others perhaps reveals underlie insecurity need go war bootcamp grad would better heal way check attitude may find hard career likely work alongside bootcamp grad disdain show reflect badly,0.505582992,Subjective
xxstem,hot,2023-10-25 0:02,2018-05-07 16:46,supershinythings,Comment,How to deal with men hitting on me in school?,dylsrjh,,"This happened to me occasionally in grad school.  I was once followed out to my car by some lab assistant who DEMANDED my phone number.  I tried to be polite turning him down, but he simply insisted over and over again.  Finally I gave him a wrong number, which of course he later called.  When he angrily confronted me I angrily responded that I said NO like 5 times, and he was being really pushy, so if he wanted to make a thing of it we could go down to the Dean's office and discuss this further.  He backed off.  After that he was of course a dick to me, but that's OK.  I didn't need his kind of 'help' anyway.

As I've gotten older I've perfected a 'stare' look.  When they ask inappropriate questions or try to get too close, I stare at them for a good long time.  I don't say anything, I just stare.  Then, once things get uncomfortable, I change the subject to something work-related.  If they persist, they get the 'stare' again.  The 'stare' should not include any friendliness to it - it should be like you're staring at a dog turd on your doorstep - you're a little disgusted, a little annoyed, everything smells like shit, and really don't want to talk.  Walk away if you can, and don't break eye-contact until you're away enough.  They need to know you're not afraid of them, you're disgusted with them.  

Some people from certain cultures will be super-pushy and this won't work, but most will be OK.  For the super-pushy, you have to get rude, and do it quickly.  Don't let them think that you're 'playing', or 'flirting'.  In their culture, it's YOUR fault they're attracted to you.  So it may be necessary to talk to the Dean about this cultural difference, because they're not comprehending how offensive they're being. 

You may need to talk to a female from that country to find out what THEY do; they may have better ideas.  And if they don't, then you'll likely need to talk to either the Dean's office or Campus Police to give them an orientation about what is and is not appropriate where you are.  What you do NOT want is for them to claim that you 'led them on' because you looked in their general direction or wore something cute, which to them means they get an automatic pass into your pants.

Otherwise, I just stare and walk away or change the subject.  They'll smile, laugh, cajole, try to be charming, but you're not into it.  Look at them like they're a dog turd, imagine it, get that disgusted look, and walk away or change the subject.

If you think they can handle it, you can say, ""I don't think that's appropriate.  Let's try this again.""  Then start the conversation over from the beginning, and when it gets inappropriate, stop and say, ""right there, that's not going to work.  How about..."" And suggest something that isn't a come-on, like something work-related.  These guys are young, and may or may not think you're playing.  Unfortunately YOU are the one who has to be the adult in the room, because they still think they can do stupid shit and pretend they're just ""Joking"".  Well, you are not 'joking'.  You're just trying to get work done. 

 If it's clear they can't behave appropriately, you need to segment them into those you can be yourself around, and those you can't, because they'll behave inappropriately then backpedal to 'joking' when you stop them.  Naturally they will say stupid shit about you to your back.  But if you can establish and maintain clear boundaries, at least you can say you're doing your part.

For many guys it's a 'game'.  They push and push and push until they get somewhere.  They give each other shit when they fail, and they cheer each other on when they're able to get somewhere - then of course the target is marked as 'easy' or a 'slut' or whatever.  

They look for weak points - are you sensitive to name-calling?  That's what may work with you, so they'll do that.  Don't like comments about your appearance?  They'll do this all day long.  Feel insecure about your looks?  They'll pick this up and 'neg' you until they get somewhere.  Does flattery work?  Awesome.  They're there.  They're 'playing', testing, to see what works on you.  You, OTOH, don't really get any information on what works on them.  So you only have a few options, most of which are nuclear.

It's just a game, a joke, to them.  And you don't get to look for weak points because they'll just escalate.  It's a vicious little game they play.  To play this game back, unfortunately you have to separate yourself emotionally from the threat you're feeling and realize that they're playing this game.  This is incredibly hard to do, because your mind is NOT in that space when you're interacting - they're taking work-related conversations and trying to subvert them to serve their own selfish inappropiate agenda.  Your need to catch this and redirect it back.  This requires awareness and some pre-planning.

Realize that they're not emotionally impacted by their own behavior.   But to us, it's a very real threat to our physical and emotional sovereignty.  So they need to understand that you are NOT playing.  You are setting and enforcing boundaries, and you need to be willing to take it out of game play into the serious arena if this shit keeps up.  

When it gets to this degree, you're dealing essentially with sociopaths.  You need to see them as such and respond as such.  It's not your job to teach them appropriate behavior but it IS your job to protect yourself any way you can.",5459,gendered split perception,,,happen occasionally grad school follow car lab assistant demand phone number try polite turn simply insist finally give wrong number course late call angrily confront angrily respond say like 5 time really pushy want make thing could go dean office discus back course dick ok need kind help anyway gotten old perfect stare look ask inappropriate question try get close stare good long time say anything stare thing get uncomfortable change subject something work relate persist get stare stare include friendliness like star dog turd doorstep little disgusted little annoy everything smell like shit really want talk walk away break eye contact away enough need know afraid disgust people certain culture super pushy work ok super pushy get rude quickly let think play flirting culture fault attract may necessary talk dean cultural difference comprehend offensive may need talk female country find may better idea likely need talk either dean office campus police give orientation appropriate want claim lead look general direction wore something cute mean get automatic pas pant otherwise stare walk away change subject smile laugh cajole try charm look like dog turd imagine get disgust look walk away change subject think handle say think appropriate let try start conversation begin get inappropriate stop say right go work suggest something come like something work relate guy young may may think play unfortunately one adult room still think stupid shit pretend joke well joke try get work do clear behave appropriately need segment around behave inappropriately backpedal joke stop naturally say stupid shit back establish maintain clear boundary least say part many guy game push push push get somewhere give shit fail cheer able get somewhere course target mark easy slut whatever look weak point sensitive name call may work like comment appearance day long feel insecure look pick neg get somewhere flattery work awesome playing test see work otoh really get information work option nuclear game joke get look weak point escalate vicious little game play play game back unfortunately separate emotionally threat feel realize playing game incredibly hard mind space interact take work related conversation try subvert serve selfish inappropiate agenda need catch redirect back require awareness pre plan realize emotionally impacted behavior us real threat physical emotional sovereignty need understand play set enforce boundary need willing take game play serious arena shit keep get degree deal essentially sociopath need see respond job teach appropriate behavior job protect way,0.560404002,Subjective

Congress just snuck it into the must-pass omnibus package.,dw4iszo,,">I think you missed the concept they would fight FOR their families. Not abandon them.

Okay, cool.  But then what if me and my family, along with hundreds of millions of others, think that anyone who would start shooting innocent Americans to solve their problem are bad and fighting for us meant killing these rebels.

Like everything else, it will be split.  What you're talking about here is a civil war, not a revolution.  And like the last civil war, the only people who get hurt there are Americans.  It serves no one, it helps no one, and hundreds of millions die.  Our country is weakened by it in EVERY conceivable metric.

>A foreign nation would only create solidarity equal or greater than 9/11.

The solidarity of a broken, starving, half-dead nation that's been at war with itself for 20 years isn't much.

>I think you have the idea that any group would be like Isis camps or waco which is not how it will be.

Oh okay, so how will it be?  What feasible scenario do you see where any kind of violent, armed rebellion against the United States Government would spring up overnight across the entire nation, involve millions of people all simultaneously abandoning the rule of law, and would murder most of our government creating the largest power vacuum in history?

Would love to hear how you think it could ever possibly play out in the real world.  What you're talking about right now is not a revolution, it's a civil war.  A civil war is infinitely more possible (though still nearing 0% in probability), but is bad for everyone in every way which everyone knows, so it's very unlikely.

>Really? Do you ever see these fools speeches? Did you not see Pelosi smiling (which she rarely does) with glee when trump mentioned removing guns from people without due process.

And?  Did they pass any laws to take guns without due process?  Or did all the politicians step up and say, ""Hey Trump, that's a dumb fucking idea and we're not doing that.""

>Another great example is jim crow. The people did not want it. They did not want it. It was voted in by corrupt politicians.

Oh yeah I forgot about the Jim Crow revolution where people rose up and murdered all our government officials cause they hated it so much.  Thanks for reminding me about how Jim Crow laws were solved with widespread violence against the government instead of activism.

>Funny because that's how it was founded.

A civil war is not at all how we were founded.  This isn't taxation without representation.  We don't have issues that we are ALL in agreement on anymore in this country.  There is no revolution with 99% on one side and 1% on the other, that doesn't exist anymore.  We are more divided than we've ever been and continue to become even more so.  In no world other than a dream world does everyone come together for some kind of violent revolution that ends in a positive way for the American people.  None.

>We are 3 days away from that regardless at any point in time. It's irrelevant what the cause is. That is pretty well know. Its on YOU to be prepared not the government or your neighbor.

But they're not.  See old people who can't get out of their house, they aren't prepared for those disasters.  Children and single moms, they don't have fucking doomsday bunkers and all rational, reasonable citizens understand that.

So that's why it's in the best interests of ALL involved that society continue to function, and why ALL violent uprisings can, will, and SHOULD be dealt with aggressively by our military.  And they are and will continue to be.

Because I don't care how pure your intentions are or what you think you're fighting for, if you think it's acceptable to lose tens of millions of innocent lives to start a war and destroy our society in order to further your own ambitions then you and everyone like you is a terrorist.  That's not how democracies, especially not the shining city on the hill, solve their problems.  And people who think it is, well that's who we pay the military to deal with.  Right now, they're dealing with them overseas.  They will be happy to come back over here and do the same thing at home if it happens.

Every last one of the people who try to rise up and attack our government will be rightfully branded traitors and terrorists and there will be no end to the number of soldiers who will support the rule of law and the sanctity of our nation over violence and death and anarchy.

>The reality is that there would be a temporary power vaccumn leaving room for a charismatic authoritarian to fill that void. It wouldn't come from the outside.

Nope.  The reality is that there would be no charismatic authoritarians who could possibly take the lead and control anything.  The nation would dissolve into dozens of factions fighting each other, all of them with fractured morale, none of them willing to acquiesce to the others, and that would continue for decades of time.  We couldn't manage to wrap up our shit in the middle east and we've been over there for like 40 fucking years now trying to sort that out.  You think we're just going to have a nice, neat, clean little civil war here?

No, there's no grass left for there to be rifles behind when foreign, hostile nations come in and take over.  They are just rebuilding in our wreckage at that point. 

>If the united states collapsed the rest if the world would too considering when run the show. Most of the internet infrastructure is based here for example. The world runs on the dollar and it's failure would cause a firestorm of economic collapse across the world.

Yup.  Even more reason why a civil war would be a disaster that foreign nations would step in to resolve.  And why our government and our military will stop at absolutely nothing to ensure it doesn't happen.  They will nuke a major American city before they allow us to dissolve into civil war and destroy our society.  They will use drones to drop chemical weapons on our own soil before they let that happen.  There is no end to the tactics that US government will use to maintain it's power in the world.

As you pointed out earlier, they swore an oath to protect against enemies both foreign and domestic.

ladydevs,hot,2023-10-24 20:52,2019-03-04 19:08,xiguy1,Comment,"ELI5: How are our Phones so resistant to bugs, viruses, and crashing, when compared to a Computer?",eht025n,,"This is an excellent question OP and I am going to try to offer a partial answer - on security in phones. For a start, any mobile device which has a CPU, RAM, an OS, and an ability to connect with other devices is at risk. 

This includes, cell phones, tablets, some cameras, some in car systems, etc. Those devices are not inherently resistant to security threats but are less of a target for some kinds of attacks (e.g. large scale malware and ransomware) because the people who initiate the attacks normally want to be paid and they can't make much by infecting or encrypting data on a phone (that is changing). 

As well, people on phones tend to use apps much more than Web services, and so they are less prone to downloaded malware and some other kinds of attacks. However, phones are much more prone to phishing (email, text, MMS) of all types as phone users tend to take security less seriously than they should and often respond to phishing attempts without thinking it over. 

The fact that most phones ship without security apps is a part of the problem, but the constant use of social media, texting, Cloud and other services from phones is really the bigger issue. People on phones often inter-mix personal data (useful to criminals for things like more phishing attacks, fraud, black mail, etc.) with work data (valuable to intellectual property thieves, corporate spies, nation state actors, etc.). Those people know that an average person is likely to have both types of data on their phone (e.g. business emails sent to the phone, docs stored from work via the phone, into a Cloud folder). 

So, phones are a target and they are under attack. Most of the time, attackers want your data. That is worth more to them than the phone (some exceptions apply). They are less of a target for **some** kinds of attacks but the threats that are on the rise include:

* phishing (as mentioned);
* Social engineering (convincing users to share sensitive or private information with another person through manipulation);
* Surveillance of the user and their location/transactions/shared contacts, etc. via text monitoring, audio tagging, metadata collection, GPS, and a lot more. Much surveillance is done because the user agreed to terms of service without understanding them. Some is done by malicious actors though. 
* Malware (on the rise, including to take control of the phone for things like crypto mining)
* Malicious WiFi hotspots (someone puts up a hotspot so phone users will connect, and then scans their communications looking for something they can steal/use).

Computers are prone to the same stuff, except that most PCs come with built-in security features, especially under Windows 10 and Mac OS X and from Intel (another whole story) and a lot of users install and run Anti-malware software, a basic firewall, etc. to help secure the PC. PCs get hit far more often than phones and the numbers are staggering, so manufacturers tend to take security seriously (e.g. Microsoft).

The protections in place on phones are unique though as follows:

1. Apple implements security in iOS (running apps in controlled and secure ""sandboxes""), uses encryption widely to protect user data (e.g. in iMessage) and in hardware (built in encryption hardware, etc. In a nutshell, Apple iOS is a closed system and that makes it much harder for attackers to figure out the inner workings and then plan/launch attacks
2. Android, as an OS also forces apps to run in a controlled sandbox, runs a hardened kernel (the ""core"" of the OS).  and support a bunch of encryption options (some run w/o user notice). Android is implemented on a ton of different hardware though and so things like device access hardware, file segregation, absence of bloatware, provision of security apps, and lots of other things is down the the phone manufacturer (e.g. Samsung) and some do security well (OnePlus) and some don't (you can google that :)
3. Both also provide tools to find lost/stolen phones, lock the phone, check that apps are signed and from a known source, block apps, protect OS files, etc 

Things start to break down if:

1. Users jailbreak their phone
2. Side load apps from unknown sites (i.e. not Apple or Google)
3. Don't use a password, facial recog., thumb print or SOMETHING to lock the phone
4. Share their device with others who may not be careful and diligent about security of YOUR phone and data

All of those things put your phone at greater risk. 

A few tips on what you can do to improve phone security:

1. Set up a phone login and use a strong PIN or password or switch to biometrics...(at least 8 characters for a PIN)
2. Turn on phone tracing in case it is lost or stolen
3. BACK-UP important info (e.g. contacts) from the phone to a PC or into the Cloud in case you need to restore it later
4. Password protect any Cloud accounts with a strong (like 12+ characters) password
5. Install a password vault so you do NOT save passwords in something like Note or EverNote (bad idea and password vaults are free or cheap)
6. Install **all** vendor patches and updates, especially if they say ""Security enhancements"". This is a big issue in Android. Many vendors (looking at you Google) don't offer support for older phones. So, people who can't afford a new phone every 2-3 years are prone to newer attacks (because...no patches)
7. Install anti-malware apps and set them up to auto scan apps, incoming data, etc
8. Only install apps from reputable sources and check the security/privacy settings for all apps. If you are done with an app or have suspicions about how it is behaving (often hard to know), consider deleting it
9. Don't use social media apps on the phone. Seriously, they all suck and all (especially some in the news lately) take your data ALL the time
10. Read up on your phone's security features and apply those you understand (if not sure, read more)

All of this applies to phones and tablets. Also, I know I didn't fully answer your question so it comes down to this ""more attacks on PCs, because they are data rich and may provide a pay day so vendors offer more security some built in and some you buy""...but things with phones are getting worse and because phones are the gateway to much more (Cloud, remote to home, banking, etc.) they must be secured.

girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:30,2021-03-16 1:26,anonymousdontfireme,Post,I'm a programmer sitting in on candidate screening meetings. Here is what I learned about who gets hired.,m61uu3,,"I'm a senior developer and I got to sit in on some meetings looking for potential junior web developers. I didn't get much say, but here is what I learned.

&#x200B;

* I had no idea how important it is just to see that the candidate is available. Lots of CVs went right in the trash because their address was far away, or their current job or place of study was far away. If you live nearby, makes sure it shows clearly. If you are moving nearby, make that very clear.
* Similarly, we got a lot of CVs from students who weren't done studying yet. If it was clear they were about to be done soon, they were called in for an interview. Lots of CVs went in the trash because they listed their education as something like *2019-present* and we couldn't tell if they were doing some 5-year degree or a 2-year-degree or what, so we just didn't know when they would be available to work. If they wrote *2019-2021* we knew they would be available soon.
* Job hopping actually wasn't a big deal, but location hopping was because it also raised questions about availability. Similarly, someone from another country who came here for study raised questions about whether they would go back to their homeland. You need to reassure the hirers that you plan to stay. If you come from a country with a different mother tongue, one way you can show you plan to stay is by mentioning on your CV that you are taking classes to improve your language skills.
* Work experience is far more valuable than education. A candidate with a 2-year-degree and one year of work experience doing something programming-related is more impressive than someone with a Master's degree and no work experience. The work experience does not have to be particularly impressive. Just a job where you were doing some coding as part of your duties goes a long way.
* Lots of candidates were rejected who were really  liked, but just didn't have enough education or experience yet. When those candidates try again in a year or so, they get brownie points. Hirers really like to see people trying again.
* No one got told the real reason they were rejected. Everyone basically got a copy-paste rejection that was written to look personal, but was not.
* An amazing CV with a short generic cover letter goes in the trash.
* People hate CVs that have blue text on white backgrounds. Funky CV templates are completely fine and can be eye-catching but by far the most important thing is that it's easy to read. One guy sent his CV in a .txt file in addition to a .doc and he got major brownie points.
* We got a lot of ""alternate pipeline"" CVs, like for example someone has been working at a nail salon and has been taking evening classes learning to program and is looking for a chance to prove themselves. I am so sad to see that those kinds of CVs usually get thrown out without even getting a chance to show their code or get an interview. When those CVs do get through, it is because they wrote an amazing cover letter. 
* Attaching a photo to your CV helps, just because it makes you look more personal and memorable among lots of CVs. Don't stress too much about the photo. It can be a professional-looking photo in a suit, or just a shot of you with your dog or whatever.
* You do not need to gush about the company and how great it is. The person reading it is just doing their job and probably not a huge cheerleader for the company. But they are looking for someone who fits in, so do some research about what kind of culture they have and show in your cover letter that you're the kind of person who fits in there. For example, show you're a fun funky person if it has a fun funky culture or that you're a strict conservative person if it has more of a strict conservative culture.
* If you don't have much work experience as a programmer, but any of your previous jobs have involved design, usability, accessibility or project management, that is a plus. Make sure it says so. For example, one CV was about to go in the trash when I pointed out that her work experience included being a ""project assistant"" at a company. No one else had heard of the company so this meant nothing. I had heard of that company and happened to know that they develop technological solutions to improve accessibility for the disabled. Accessibility is a big topic in IT right now, so this was valuable experience, but she only got through because of luck. Her chances would be much better if she had herself written this on her CV.
* It's not unusual to get a candidate who everyone thinks is great, but then the boss says no because of some weird non-sensical detail. Bosses aren't technical and sometimes get very confused about whether someone is technically proficient and they don't always listen to the programmers. We had one candidate who was perfect but the boss couldn't let go that he didn't know Docker, even though we tried to explain we could teach him in a day. So we hired someone who knew a lot less. Then there was one full stack developer, but we were looking for a frontend developer and he somehow decided it was a bad thing that she knew backend too. So we hired someone who knew less frontend but only frontend. My point here is don't take it personally if you're rejected because people get rejected for ridiculous reasons all the time.
* CVs get dug out of the trash if someone at the company knows them and vouches for them. It is very good to have friends.

If you are looking for a job as a junior and are not a strong candidate, my best advice is to find any opportunity to put some work experience on your CV. Once you've got that, it gets so much easier. Talk to your boss about making a web app that could be used internally to improve productivity at whatever you currently do. Volunteer to make a web app for a charity. If you have time, start a small business and make an app in your free time - even if you have 3 customers. Just some kind of real world experience programming makes so much difference on your CV.

Also, please know that your past will not haunt you through your career. If you are not a strong candidate now, it's very difficult to get your foot in the door. But once you do, you are in. Once you have a couple years good experience on your CV, you have zero problem getting a new job. Once you have worked with someone established in the industry who can vouch for you, you are good to go. And once you have about 5 years good experience, you will be fighting off recruiters trying to hire you.",6495,gendered split perception,,,senior developer get sit meeting look potential junior web developer get much say learn x200b idea important see candidate available lot cvs go right trash address far away current job place study far away live nearby make sure show clearly move nearby make clear similarly get lot cv student do study yet clear do soon call interview lot cvs go trash list education something like 2019 present tell 5 year degree 2 year degree know would available work write 2019 2021 knew would available soon job hop actually big deal location hop also raise question availability similarly someone another country come study raise question whether would go back homeland need reassure hirer plan stay come country different mother tongue one way show plan stay mention cv taking class improve language skill work experience far valuable education candidate 2 year degree one year work experience something program related impressive someone master degree work experience work experience particularly impressive job cod part duty go long way lot candidate reject really like enough education experience yet candidate try year get brownie point hirer really like see people try one get tell real reason reject everyone basically get copy paste rejection write look personal amazing cv short generic cover letter go trash people hate cvs blue text white background funky cv template completely fine eye catch far important thing easy read one guy send cv txt file addition doc get major brownie point get lot alternate pipeline cv like example someone work nail salon take evening class learn program look chance prove sad see kind cvs usually get throw without even get chance show code get interview cv get write amazing cover letter attach photo cv help make look personal memorable among lot cvs stress much photo professional look photo suit shot dog whatever need gush company great person read job probably huge cheerleader company look someone fit research kind culture show cover letter kind person fit example show fun funky person fun funky culture strict conservative person strict conservative culture much work experience programmer previous job involve design usability accessibility project management plus make sure say example one cv go trash point work experience include project assistant company one else hear company mean nothing heard company happen know develop technological solution improve accessibility disable accessibility big topic right valuable experience get luck chance would much good write cv unusual get candidate everyone think great bos say weird non sensical detail boss technical sometimes get confused whether someone technically proficient always listen programmer one candidate perfect bos let go know docker even though tried explain could teach day hire someone know lot less one full stack developer look frontend developer somehow decide bad thing know backend hire someone know less frontend frontend point take personally reject people get reject ridiculous reason time cv get dug trash someone company know vouches good friend look job junior strong candidate best advice find opportunity put work experience cv get get much easy talk boss make web app could use internally improve productivity whatever currently volunteer make web app charity time start small business make app free time even 3 customer kind real world experience program make much difference cv also please know past haunt career strong candidate difficult get foot door couple year good experience cv zero problem get new job work someone establish industry vouch good go 5 year good experience fight recruiter try hire,0.527744864,Subjective
girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:33,2023-09-28 23:34,syrenashen,Post,Ode to my women mentors and women managers,16v0vi3,,"I'm a woman who's been in this industry for 10 years, 15 years including internships. I never coded before college, but due to a large amount of encouragement from both women and men around me, I got a degree in CS against my parents' wishes and my own expectations of myself.

I've been talking to many women in this industry and reading about their experiences here which made me realize how lucky and unique my experiences were (although I don't think it's just luck\*), so I wanted to virtually thank the many women mentors in my life that have helped get me where I am today.

I was lucky to have gone to a school that didn't have a 50/50 ratio in CS but it wasn't far off either. It's an engineering school that consciously tries to maintain a balanced ratio. My CS class was around 60/40 which was really fucking great, so I never had the experience of being the only woman in the class. I didn't know how to code AT ALL, and tbh it was a huge struggle but no one said ""girls shouldn't be here"" or anything to me just because there were so many amazing female role models, professors, TAs, and grad students around.

My first serious internship was an internship at Google. I applied super late because I didn't believe I'd get accepted (I applied in May which, if you have normal summer internship experience, that's very late for an internship that starts in June). There weren't many projects left but someone at Google saw my resume and picked me up and asked for a super late internship slot for me, got it approved, and that was when I got my dream of interning at Google. I learned how to program there. I had never done production-level coding on a team before; most of my schoolwork was solo coding or theory-based so I had not worked with more than 1 person on a codebase. So that internship really taught me a lot.

My mentor was also great; I was out sick for a few weeks during the 12 week internship, and she got an approval to extend the internship a few weeks so I could submit my project and get a return offer. I didn't end up going back to Google, but she taught me a lot. At the time, I felt guilty & thought ""Gee why is this woman spending all of her time teaching me, a clueless noob, the complete basics of coding including how to use the command line? And debugging things for me when things go wrong? This can't be fun or benefitial to her."" I felt like I brought no value as an intern, but she told me that bringing value as an intern is considered going above and beyond.

After that I worked at a company that had almost no women. It was super toxic and people were constantly threatening & harassing each other. I got reported to HR a few times for stupid things like my short skirt bothered people. I left after 6 months.

Then after that I got a job where I had a series of managers. My first manager, a man, was nice to my face but shit talked about me behind my back. People were coming up to me telling me that my manager was disappointed in my progress, thought I was a mistake hire, etc, and I didn't understand why or how to improve because he never said ANY criticism to my face. He always said ""good job"" and didn't bother to give me any direction on what to work on. I cried a bunch after receiving that 2nd-hand feedback, until suddenly my manager quits and I got a new manager, a woman.

Some male co-workers told me my new manager sucked, and I cried again and contemplated switching teams. But she was really nice and supportive. She told me that she would help me get promoted, something my previous manager never ever mentioned. I felt like she cared about me as a person and my growth as an engineer. She maintained a team that was around 50% women. I have a few close friends from that team still. I ended up transferring teams anyway, though I left on a high note, and she gave me glowing reviews to my new team.

My next manager was also a woman, and we were in a satellite office. The team was >50% women. We even had cancel the ""Women in Tech"" ERG chapter in that satellite office because it was too many women. She said it felt like it would be more exclusionary than inclusionary due to the office being >50% women. I didn't get along with her too well due to differences in opinion, but she still treated me fairly. Again, I really appreciated being in such a balanced gender team. I did end up getting laid off during a companywide layoff during COVID, and she cried when I was laid off and was super supportive. She also quit afterwards in protest.

After that, I joined a new company and a team that was again 50% or even >50% women at times, under a woman manager. She was amazing. She was both my manager and my mentor. First of all, she hired me at a higher level than I was expecting. I literally thought there was no way I'd be hired in at that level. So much so that I only found out I was hired at that level *after I joined*. (It was an L for negotiation though.) After that, she got me by far the highest impact projects on the team and promoted me again in 1 year. I never thought I'd be in this position and gained so much confidence from the experience because my previous career trajectory was not going anywhere near that fast. I realized just how important your manager's support is.

Finally, now I started a startup with another woman, a three-time successful founder, and we just got funded by a top VC. I'm super excited and find her super inspirational. In fact, every day I feel lucky that she picked me of all people to work with. She has lots of different strengths that are complimentary to mine, and I learn a lot from just observing her interact with the product & the people around us every day. I feel super lucky.

Anyway, all this to say: TL;DR: Female mentors and managers have been the reason I'm where I am today. Balanced gender ratio teams are fucking awesome. Keep fighting for this world because as someone who has worked with a few male managers and heavily male-dominated teams, it makes a HUGE difference. I've had a few male mentors as well, but this is an ode to my most wonderful, superhuman, generous, kind, inspirational, selfless, extremely competent woman mentors 🙏✨

\*I don't think it's just luck but also selection bias. I think women managers are more likely to hire women, and also women like me are more likely to join teams with more women. I've had offers where I'd be the only woman and that always gave me the ick. I do understand that most other women in the industry don't have the luxury of choosing safer teams.",6542,gendered split perception,,,woman industry 10 year 15 year include internship never cod college due large amount encouragement woman men around get degree c parent wish expectation talk many woman industry reading experience make realize lucky unique experience although think luck want virtually thank many woman mentor life help get today lucky go school 50 50 ratio c far either engineering school consciously try maintain balance ratio cs class around 60 40 really fuck great never experience woman class know code tbh huge struggle one say girl anything many amazing female role model professor tas grad student around first serious internship internship google apply super late believe get accept applied may normal summer internship experience late internship start june many project leave someone google saw resume pick asked super late internship slot get approve get dream intern google learn program never do production level cod team schoolwork solo cod theory base work 1 person codebase internship really taught lot mentor also great sick week 12 week internship get approval extend internship week could submit project get return offer end go back google taught lot time felt guilty thought gee woman spending time teach clueless noob complete basic cod include use command line debug thing thing go wrong fun benefitial felt like bring value intern tell bring value intern consider go beyond work company almost woman super toxic people constantly threaten harass get report hr time stupid thing like short skirt bother people leave 6 month get job series manager first manager man nice face shit talk behind back people come telling manager disappoint progress think mistake hire etc understand improve never say criticism face always say good job bother give direction work cry bunch receive 2nd hand feedback suddenly manager quits get new manager woman male co worker tell new manager suck cry contemplated switch team really nice supportive told would help get promote something previous manager never ever mention felt like care person growth engineer maintain team around 50 woman close friend team still end transfer teams anyway though left high note give glow reviews new team next manager also woman satellite office team 50 woman even cancel woman tech erg chapter satellite office many woman say felt like would exclusionary inclusionary due office 50 woman get along well due difference opinion still treat fairly really appreciate balanced gender team end get lay companywide layoff covid cry laid super supportive also quit afterwards protest join new company team 50 even 50 woman time woman manager amazing manager mentor first hire high level expect literally think way hire level much find hire level join l negotiation though get far high impact project team promote 1 year never think position gain much confidence experience previous career trajectory go anywhere near fast realize important manager support finally start startup another woman three time successful founder get funded top vc super excite find super inspirational fact every day feel lucky picked people work lots different strength complimentary mine learn lot observe interact product people around us every day feel super lucky anyway say tl dr female mentor manager reason today balance gender ratio team fuck awesome keep fighting world someone work male manager heavily male dominated team make huge difference male mentor well ode wonderful superhuman generous kind inspirational selfless extremely competent woman mentor think luck also selection bias think woman manager likely hire woman also woman like likely join team woman offer woman always give ick understand woman industry luxury choose safe team,0.581891206,Subjective
girlsgonewired,top,2023-10-24 19:33,2021-05-23 11:32,techthrowaway0523,Post,having trouble finding the right balance of soft and technical skills needed to keep advancing,nja3h2,,"I'm about a decade into my career, working in software development in a very niche industry. Up until somewhat recently, I have been able to find a clear path to continue advancing my career, which I would like to continue doing - I am actually not necessarily interested in staying in deeply technical roles long term, and would like to position myself to go into director and eventually executive level roles.

I spent the early part of my career in individual contributor roles writing and maintaining software in my niche industry, then spent about two years in technical lead roles where I did everything from architecting complex greenfield projects to sprint planning to requirements gathering to code reviews to documentation to interviews blah blah.

Two years ago, I moved from being my engineering team's technical lead into my company's first technical product management role. All our stakeholders were internal to the company (important later.) This is when I started to run into trouble. I had a lot of credibility with the developers and got along very well with the director of engineering (who I worked very closely with.) However, over time I noticed important stakeholders seemingly intentionally excluding me from conversations that I needed to be in, then increasingly gendered things began happening, like someone would ask who was taking notes in a meeting, and a stakeholder would reply that I was doing that (when in fact, I was not, and I was in the meeting to participate in the workflow discussion aspects so I could tell the engineering team what to build.)

This continued to get worse, escalating into a situation where one of the problematic stakeholders had gotten together a group of other stakeholders, who were deep in dictating technical implementation details without anyone from engineering present (not their job or mine in that role.) The guy who organized it hadn't included me, but eventually someone in the group decided I should be there and invited me. When I saw what they were doing, I tried to pull them back to defining the problem statement rather than implementation details. The stakeholder who had organized the group became upset and verbally abusive. He later complained to upper management, who told me to watch my tone with him and that I would be fired if this stakeholder complained about me again.

A few months later, the director of engineering for the group that I worked with resigned. The CTO made a verbal offer to me to take on the role, which I asked to think about for a few days. Before I could say either way, the CTO called me and said that he had to renege his offer because the rest of the executive team said so. I would later learn that 'some of the stakeholders' had gone to the executives and told them that they didn't trust me to do the job, that I was not qualified to manage, hire and retain engineers, that my value to the organization was in 'organizing things and taking notes' and, my favorite bit, ""they were expecting a **different type of person** to do this job.""

Probably not a big surprise that I decided at this point to not work there anymore; within a month I had lined up a job at a competitor and given notice.

In my new company, I am back in a technical lead role where I have several peer technical leads. I am the only female tech lead. I should have seen this situation I'm in coming from a mile away, because during the interview process the eng director told me that they were really impressed with my soft skills, acted skeptical that I would be able to participate in code reviews since I was coming from a PM role (they use a language I wrote software in for nearly a decade...), and that I could ""rely on <peer tech lead> for technical guidance"" (I decided to interpret this as ""for technical guidance with our proprietary things until you get familiar."" Mistake #1.)

So I start this new job, and my manager (who is not the eng director, but a people-y manager from a non-dev background) sits me down like the third day to say that he's going to ""rely on me a lot for 'the people things' with the team,"" to which I said nothing because like, I'm brand new and I genuinely don't know what he actually means by that. I decide to ignore him and focus on getting up to speed with their tech stack.

It becomes clear there is no actual plan to onboard me and the other male tech leads begin trying to delegate their work to me because I haven't been given anything of my own to look after. I pushed back and essentially wrestled several areas away from some of them so that I had something to be actually the lead of.

It's still early days in this new job, but I am increasingly worried by several things that have happened already:

* I wrote an email to another part of the organization asking for clarification about some details of a project they were handing off to our team, which I cc'd my peer tech leads on because they needed those details as well. One of them chatted me privately and told me it was a ""great email."" Ya'll, I promise it was just a normal email. Dudes out there, do you send messages to other dude engineers complimenting their emails??
* I got asked if I would participate in a committee that is trying to improve our recruiting processes; I said sure I'll sit in to see what is going on. Oops, turns out this was a way for peer tech lead to hot potato recruiting / outreach stuff to someone else (he immediately peaced out of the committee as soon as I joined.) I should have said no but it's hard when you're brand new.
* I got randomly invited to a call that a peer tech lead should have been in as well, then told afterwards that the people on the call wanted to deal with me instead because of my 'superior soft skills.' The call was about something non-technical that is all our responsibilities to deal with.
   * After this incident, I actually sent the person who made the 'soft skills' comment the ""glue work"" article and explained to him that I would not take on 'soft' work that my peers did not have to do. He acted like I was being unreasonable, said it was part of my job, and insisted women being pushed into soft skill work ""doesn't happen here."" Thankfully he's not in charge of me.
* I wrote down some technical documentation that the junior engineers on our team needed to have readily accessible, because no one else had done it (ugh I know, oops). One of the other tech leads sent me a message complimenting it and said he could see I was a ""documenting type."" I asked him to not say that again.
* I genuinely don't even remember what the lead up to this was, but one of the other tech leads commented on how he felt that I was a 'more managerial' person and contrasted me with another of our peers, who was 'more technical.' He has known me for all of like two months, how did he decide that??

Generally I now have an incredibly low tolerance for anything I perceive as even remotely gendered.

* one of the tech leads couldn't believe that a project manager offered a 'technical answer' to a question and I told him that I thought it was unreasonable to assume that she did not know *anything* ""technical"" just because she was a PM (how does he know she doesn't do programming projects in her free time??)
* the tech leads interrupted / talked over another one of the project managers, so I interrupted them and said that I wanted to hear the rest of her thought (actually worked, yay)
* the PM wasn't available to run a meeting that me and another tech lead are also in; the other tech lead asked me to run the meeting. The next time she wasn't available, I very quickly told him that it was his turn because I had done it last time (which he did do, phew)
* one of the female PMs said something in a meeting; a few days later, what she said was attributed to me instead (only two females who had been on the original call lol), so I interrupted and pointed out that it had been her who said that information, not me

Basically I am refusing any 'soft' work unless someone can explain how it is part of my job and I see that my peer tech leads are doing the same work. I am also refusing to sit idly by during incidents of manterrupting and dudes declaring anyone else's value to be 'not technical'. I have even sent my male peers unsolicited articles about how women in technology get voluntold to do 'glue' work when they insinuated that I should do said work.

Am I being ""too extra"" in this new job? I feel like I'm carrying so much baggage from what happened to me at my last company.  I don't know how else to stand up for myself when people try to saddle me with work that I'm not interested in doing right now / didn't think I was hired to do, and to make sure that I actually have time / space to build technical credibility with this team (instead of getting bogged down in ""the people things"" that others keep alluding to wanting me to do.)

I know the 'soft' side of things is important to keep advancing in my career but I can't help feeling like I'm already being typecast again in this new role.",9072,gendered split perception,,,decade

girlsgonewired,hot,2023-10-24 19:10,2023-06-18 18:40,Byeuji,Post,The future of /r/GirlsGoneWired,14cxfe9,,"Hey everyone,

Welcome back to the subreddit. It's been a wild couple weeks. 

We took GirlsGoneWired [dark last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/comments/140udhz/on_june_12th_rgirlsgonewired_will_be_going_dark/) as part of the protest against the [reddit announcement to changes in API access for third party app developers,](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/142kct8/eli5_why_are_subreddits_going_dark/) as well as protest against the general direction reddit has been heading the last couple years.

----

#####What's going on

The API pricing released last month made it clear that not only was reddit’s intent to drive profit to the exclusion of all other values, but that they’d be willing to make it harder, sometimes impossible, to continue creating, accessing, and curating the content we all came here to celebrate. Their plan is foolhardy, poorly thought out, counter to the open and democratic principles reddit was founded on – principles that visionaries like [Aaron Swartz fought for](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Aaron_Swartz_-_The_Network_Transformation.webm) – and has already caused lasting damage to the reddit community of users, moderators and developers. All these people harmed by reddit’s greedy practices are the people who CREATE the value reddit wants to profit from.

I won’t lie: this has been demoralizing as a moderator, much as I'm sure it has been for most users in this community and across reddit. The reddit community team I’ve worked with for the last several years has been empathetic, taken notes and come back with questions or proposals showing they listened carefully and understood our concerns, in spite of the rest of the company’s prodigious lack of ability to deliver on those proposals or promises.

Over the last few weeks, I've been part of private discussions with admins on these topics, and while I hoped to encourage reddit to listen to us and to drive meaningful change in collaboration with reddit admins, our discussions have been met with equivocation at best or outright obfuscation and lies at worst. Even still, the courageous community team has continually expressed a desire to find a middle ground with us – but their efforts, and ours, have been continually undercut by the immature and unprofessional conduct of their CEO. The source of the problem here is not all of reddit, but rather Steve Huffman.

Under his leadership, reddit has re-cast the love and care of third party developers as greed, while failing to enumerate or acknowledge the ways those developers enabled users to create, access and curate content for the platform and the monetary value that created for reddit.

Reddit has also placed at risk the love and care that moderators bring to this platform, who try to grow inclusive and diverse communities and protect users from spammers, hate groups, bad actors, and unethical marketing and research practices. They have failed to listen to moderators for years, and now throw all the good will and trust we’ve tried to build in the garbage as they seek to extract maximum value for our unpaid efforts.

And reddit does all of this while disguising their own interests for profit as representing the interests of users.

Unfortunately, /u/spez  doesn’t seem to care about or understand what redditors (or even his teams) want and is willing to burn it all down. [In interviews he has threatened to remove moderation teams,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14ahqjo/mods_will_be_removed_one_way_or_another_spez/) and for some large subreddits they’ve already begun threatening those teams to ‘reopen or else’. This, frankly, is abhorrent and an [embarrassment to the community that we all have spent years of our lives moderating for free, through the good and the bad.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305119836778)

----
#####The Big Choice

This leaves our moderation team in the precarious position of choosing between:

1. Opening the subreddit back up    
or
2. Continuing our protest, while being unable to create the safety and community we came to share with other women and non-binary folk, and risk losing it all to a team reddit could install over us who might care nothing for the community and our values (or worse, and more likely, would try to exploit or destroy it intentionally)

Some might think that last fear is hyperbolic, but anyone who moderates reddit or has any history in communities like ours focused around women and other marginalized communities will know this fear to be well-founded and likely. In spite of our only desire to celebrate and support women (especially in tech), this community has been constantly under attack by various groups who seek to control feminine and queer expression, who cast our community and experiences as exclusionary by projection of their own self-hatred, or would dictate to us what genders and skin colors or nationalities can speak or be listened to. 

Moderating this community in spite of those forces for a decade has been difficult to say the least.

I am re-opening our subreddit today not because our protest has ended, but because reddit will destroy this community too if I don’t. I love this community and what you all bring to it and what we stand for together. The idea that it might be destroyed terrifies me and would immediately put to waste all the efforts of thousands of users for so many years.

#####Where this subreddit started 

Nearly 11 years ago, /u/barklesparkles messaged the moderators of /r/girlgamers if any of us would be interested in helping her build a subreddit for women in tech. Back then, /u/lingrush, /u/capslock and I were working feverishly to build a community for women gamers and defending it against MRAs, homophobes and transphobes, racists, and all other sorts. All three of us worked or had backgrounds in technical fields.

So our response was unanimously an emphatic ""Yes!""

Barkle added all three of us on and we started working to grow this community. But then something happened I don't think any of us expected, but seems to happen to nearly everyone: our lives changed. I know, shocking.

At first, it seemed to work to our advantage, as each of us moved through the tech industry, growing our knowledge and expertise, and trying to share that with the community here. But as we got older, we got busier, and frankly things started to fall off. 

Several years ago, barkle and capslock left the mod team to focus on other things, and since then, frankly it's just been me moderating this community. Lingrush is still a very close friend, but she's busy with stuff that would blow your mind. I can get her on a text message pretty quick, but I hate to bother her.

If anything comes of the events of the last few weeks, my only desire is that this community regains an active, healthy and engaging team of moderators to help guide this community toward growth and success. We built this community to support women in tech, and I want to ensure it does that for a long time to come.

#####The Way Forward

Moderating this community alone has been difficult, and not been fair to this community. My free time over the last several years has vanished at an increasing rate and much of it has gone to moderating other larger communities on reddit. As a result, as this community has started to enter the stage where it could explode in growth, I have not been able to give you the attention you deserve. Too often comments go unmoderated for days, and harms in those comments go unaddressed. 

I apologize to the community for any impacts this has had on you, and for anyone who left this community in the belief that they didn't belong here because of that. 

I sincerely thank those of you in the community who have actively reported these comments, or engaged in verbal combat in defense of your sisters and niblings. You are the true heroes in this community. 

These changes at reddit, this betrayal by spez, has forced me to re-evaluate both the effort I put into this site (and my desire to use it at all), as well as the scope of positive impact I can have on this community. Losing moderators as a result of these changes in other communities I moderate has driven re-evaluation home even more. I cannot moderate this or any community alone, and even if I could, I don't think I'd do a good job. I would rather focus on my own life now than mitigating reddit's next premeditated disaster or failing to give this community the support that it needs. 

To that end, while I am re-opening the subreddit, I am actively seeking new moderation team members to continue this community in the future. If you have an interest in carrying the torch for this community and helping me guide it through these changing times, please [use this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezc0_E43qgczyH_lJPPTPT6F-BUGbyUUsmZfuJlTlFAc494w/viewform) to let us know. I am specifically seeking moderators who represent the diverse and inclusive community we wish to maintain.

As we grow the moderation team, we will be undertaking a transformative approach to roll out new rules, policies and procedures, and I will assist the new team in learning how to moderate and write automoderator rules (as necessary). When I feel the team is ready, I will hand off the reins. Whether that means I will resign my position or not, I will likely leave up to the moderation team. I would love to continue on in an emeritus capacity if possible – I fear leaving this moderation team might leave a hole in my soul because of how much time and effort I've poured into it, but I don't want to create an environment where other moderators feel disempowered by my presence.

In the meantime, I will continue to advocate for changes to reddit’s direction and seek outcomes that are positive for the users, moderators and developers that make reddit what it is.

No matter what happens, thank you all for bringing your experiences, love and passion to this community. I hope it lives on forever ❤️
